Not Being Lazy: The Key to Being Useful
Even if you want to be of help to others,
it's not easy to do so because what's good and how to do it vary with time and situation.
The existence of people who want to be useful can even be a nuisance.
Even if you want to be liked by others,
it's not something that can be easily achieved.
You can understand this by reversing your perspective.
When you think "I like that person,"
that person is often not trying to be liked.
If you overthink things, you might end up "targeting" someone.
You might try to achieve your goal by using some trick or doing something unnecessary,
which is not good.
You should be careful about this.
However, I've been thinking that it would be great if there were some good habits,
such as telling children, "It's good to do things like this."
This is something I've been thinking about for a long time.
And now, I think I've found the answer: "Not being lazy."
People who are useful, liked, trusted, and relied upon by others,
are not necessarily those who are trying to be so.
But I think there is a common thread among them.
That is, they are not lazy.
Even those who seem lazy or claim to be so,
are actually working hard and using their brains and bodies in various ways.
They might even be preparing things in advance, saying, "I've already done that."
This kind of behavior naturally leads to being useful, kind, and considerate.
"Not being lazy" is a wonderful talent, equal in value to special abilities.
It's not pretentious, and it can become a habit.
Thank you for coming today.
"Not being lazy" and "not being bothered" can coexist.
