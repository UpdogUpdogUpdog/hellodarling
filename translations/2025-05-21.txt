Not Being Stingy with One's Bones
 Even if you want to be of use to people,
it's not that easy to realize, as it depends on the time and situation.
The existence of someone who wants to be useful can even be a nuisance.
You may want to be liked by people, but it's not that easy to be liked.
It's understandable when you think about it from the other person's perspective.
When you think someone is likable, that person is not always trying to be liked.
If you overthink things, you may end up trying to manipulate them.
You may use underhanded tactics or pretend to be something you're not just to achieve your goals.
It's better to be careful about such things.
However, I thought it would be nice if there were good habits that could be taught to children, such as "doing this is good."
This was something I had been thinking about for a long time without getting anxious.
And now, I think, "This might be it."
People who are useful, liked, trusted, and relied upon by others are not necessarily trying to be so.
However, I think there is a common thread among them.
That is, not being stingy with one's bones.
This includes people who are often called lazy or idle, but it's actually about being able to do various things naturally and effortlessly.
They may even prepare things beforehand when no one is looking, thinking, "I've already done that."
Such actions can lead to being useful, kind, and considerate without even trying.
Not being stingy with one's bones is a wonderful talent, one that can become a habit without even trying.
Thank you for coming today. Not being stingy with one's bones and being lazy can coexist.


Note: The phrase "骨惜しみしない" (not being stingy with one's bones) is a Japanese idiom that means being willing to use one's energy and resources without being stingy or lazy.
