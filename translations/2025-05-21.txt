Bones of Contention

Do you want to help people? Do you want to be liked? Do you want to be trusted and depended upon? Do you want to be a person who is able to contribute to society?

These desires are not easy to fulfill, because the methods to achieve them are not always clear. When people express their desire to help, it can sometimes be a nuisance. Even if you want to be liked, it's not always easy to be liked by everyone. When you think about how to be liked, you might end up trying too hard, which might make people feel uncomfortable. Then you might end up doing something weird to achieve your goal without even realizing it.

On the other hand, if you think about what makes you like someone, you might realize that it's not when they try too hard. You might like someone because they are naturally kind, considerate, and understanding. You might like someone because they do things naturally, without forcing themselves to do it.

To become that kind of person, you need to stop trying too hard and stop being self-conscious. Instead, you need to become someone who is not afraid of making mistakes and who is not afraid of trying new things. In other words, you need to become someone who is not afraid of being "boneshaking."

"Boneshaking" is a Japanese word that describes someone who is not afraid of making mistakes and who is not afraid of trying new things. It's a word that describes someone who is not afraid of being different from others. It's a word that describes someone who is not afraid of being themselves.

In Japan, the word "boneshaking" is often used to describe people who are not afraid of making mistakes and who are not afraid of trying new things. It's a word that is often used to describe people who are not afraid of being different from others. It's a word that is often used to describe people who are not afraid of being themselves.

Becoming "boneshaking" is not easy, but it's worth it. When you become "boneshaking," you become someone who is not afraid of making mistakes and who is not afraid of trying new things. You become someone who is not afraid of being different from others. You become someone who is not afraid of being themselves.

So, if you want to help people, be liked, be trusted and depended upon, and be a person who is able to contribute to society, become "boneshaking." It's not easy, but it's worth it.
