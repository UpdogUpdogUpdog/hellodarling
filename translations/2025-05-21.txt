**Not Being Stingy with One's Bones**

Even if you want to be of help to others,
figuring out what to do and how to do it can be difficult,
depending on the time and situation.
It's not as easy as it seems to make it happen.
In fact, the existence of people who try too hard to be helpful can be annoying.
Wishing to be liked by others is also not a guarantee of being liked.
This is something you'll understand if you reverse your perspective.
When you think "I like that person," often that person is not someone who is trying to be liked.
Overthinking things can lead you to become overly eager to please,
and you might end up doing something unnecessary or using the wrong approach.
It's essential to be mindful of this.

Still, I wondered if there's a good habit, like telling children,
"Do this, and it'll be great!" 
I've been thinking about this for a long time, without rushing.
And now, I think I've found the answer.
People who are helpful, liked, trusted, and relied upon by others
are not necessarily trying to be that way.
However, I think there's a common thread among them.
That is, **not being stingy with one's bones**.
Even people who might seem lazy or idle
are, in fact, working hard and using their heads and bodies efficiently.
Sometimes, they might even have things prepared in advance,
saying, "I've already done that."
This kind of attitude naturally leads to being helpful, kind, and considerate.
**Not being stingy with one's bones** is a remarkable talent, equal in value to any other.
It's not forced or artificial, and it can become a natural habit.
Thank you for coming to "Almost Daily" again today.
**Not being stingy with one's bones** and being lazy can coexist.
