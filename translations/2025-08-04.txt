Pondering the Unsolvable Problems  
by Shigesato Itoi

・When I talk with acquaintances who run small shops or businesses, they often confess they've been thinking, "Things can't go on like this." It's something everyone seems to say.

Even those working mid-level jobs in companies express this sentiment, but it seems more urgent for those who are running their own businesses, no matter how small. There's no set retirement age for them. There's no guarantee they'll be doing well even two or three years from now, let alone a decade. In fact, there are already ominous signs and feelings of foreboding. While the newspapers and media buzz about the global and domestic economic climates and major societal shifts, you have to wonder if those ripples are affecting their current work. It seems more likely that the weather, be it hot, cold, rainy, or sunny, has a more significant impact. Yet, the feeling that "things can't go on like this" persists. It's an anxiety over the inability to stay as they are. Issues like labor shortages and rising costs create unfavorable conditions. So they ponder if there's any way to manage, yet simultaneously consider whether they should stop thinking altogether. Many people find themselves caught in this same cycle of thought.

I often say, almost as a polite formality, that I'm in the same boat, but in truth, I genuinely am. I've always felt that "things can't go on like this." And so, I endlessly ponder these unclear issues, searching and discussing, constantly experimenting. If only someone could provide the answers or the key, life would be so much easier, but it never works that way. It's only after thinking, "I've exhausted all options, I'm done," that a glimmer of "what if" appears, allowing me to try something new. Confidence is elusive, but if you believe you have it, it starts to grow. It's not about elevating one's career; thinking seriously about "things can't go on like this" is a crucial pursuit. And it's not just a struggle—there's excitement, too. There are days when, no matter how much you think and search, the answer doesn't come! But continuing that search is what living is all about.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. I think every small business owner feels the same way.
