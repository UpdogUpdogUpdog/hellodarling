Ueno and the Impression of Mass Extinction  
Shigesato Itoi

・I went to the "Mass Extinction Exhibition" at the National Museum of Nature and Science. I had bought a "Ueno Neighboring Set Ticket" that included both this exhibit and the "Impressionism from the Orsay Museum" at the National Museum of Western Art. Excited, I set off, only to find the Mass Extinction exhibit so popular that they were handing out tickets for a two-hour wait. I decided to leave that for another day and instead wandered through the Impressionism exhibit before heading back.

The concept of the "Mass Extinction Exhibition" is simply brilliant. People often say things like "Save the Earth," but the Earth has been and will likely remain fine for quite some time. It's the "living beings, including humans" that face extinction. In Earth's 4.6 billion-year history, life has experienced five mass extinctions (a mass extinction is when over 75% of species go extinct in a short period). Each time, life has rebounded only to face extinction once again. The last mass extinction occurred 66 million years ago with the "giant meteor impact," famously known as the event that wiped out the dinosaurs.

Mass extinctions come inevitably over long stretches of time. Given there have been five such events already, how can anyone say, "If humanity tries hard enough, we can prevent it"? In essence, we're living between the fifth and the sixth mass extinction. Humanity, which has been around for a mere 200,000 years, can talk big, but from the perspective of Earth's history, it's just a "blip!" When you think in terms of millions of years, extinction seems inevitable. People talk about going to the moon or surviving on Mars, but can we truly live "sustainably" there?

What begins after human extinction is unknown. We've never experienced it, and everything is beyond our expectations. The "truth of long time spans," which is almost laughable, makes us ponder the concept of "hope." It's amazing that there are people who planned such an exhibition and that it's packed with visitors. Perhaps, in a way, the resignation toward the future invigorates people more than the reality of contemporary society.

I haven't seen the exhibit yet, though.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. The "Impressionism Exhibition" was also wonderful—truly fascinating!
