On Learning of Love and Courage from September 11  
Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»The NHK series "The Century in Moving Images" featured an episode titled "9.11 Last Voice." The topic was the terrorist attacks on the United States, now 24 years ago. Two hijacked jets crashed into the World Trade Center in the heart of New York City. While it seemed like there was extensive reporting on the tragic events that unfolded, in retrospect, we didn't know as much as we thought.

Yet, messages sent from passengers to their families from the hijacked planes, and the harrowing footage of people desperately trying to evacuate from the skyscraper's top floors, have somehow survived. Though we often recall the two planes that struck the towers, there was also a third plane that crashed into the Pentagon and a fourth, brought down in a field after passengers and crew resisted onboard. The voice recordings from these flights still exist.

This was a monumental event that turned the peaceful routines of the day on their head, confronting people carrying their own histories with unimaginable challenges. It was a moment when countless extreme situations were born all at once. For more about the content, please watch the episode on a streaming service if you can.

The program was only 45 minutes long, but its impact was profound. I quickly understood why the title "Last Voice" was chosen. When each person is caught in an immense crisis, what are the words they feel compelled to say? Standing at the brink between life and death, what role do they feel they must fulfill? Records capturing the answers to these questions have been preserved. It is often said as "adult wisdom" that in truly dire situations, humans reveal their ugly nature. However, the voices and images preserved here depicted the exact opposite; they recorded love and courage. Even if someone thinks, "They just chose the good parts for the program," that's their prerogative, and I can't help that. I, however, want to believe in and emulate the "better side."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. Believing and thinking "It's not all bad" is also a freedom we have.
