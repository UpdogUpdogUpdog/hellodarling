In other words, this is about how I admire Chidori's Daigo.

・If you could follow along as someone thinks through something, step by step, it would be fascinating just for that reason alone. I vaguely recall there was a time when someone came to "Hobo Nikkan" and we did a project where they wrote poetry live. Was that just a dream? I’m pretty sure we did it, right? And I think Mr. Tanikawa said, "That was tough." Did I join in on that too? Or maybe I thought I’d try it someday?

Of course, it would be undeniably tough—I know that. Yet, there's a small part of me that wants to try it. What's tough, I suppose, is that it takes much longer than one imagines. I'm not sure about others, but for me, even the most trivial piece doesn't just flow out naturally. It comes out when it comes out, and it surfaces when it’s meant to surface. Even if there are times when everything seems to come together in an instant, it’s simply because it emerged at the right moment. If you were writing live, whether at a venue or streamed online, there’s a significant disconnect between the viewers' perception of time and the actual time it takes the writer to create something. It’s like being in the bathroom with someone persistently knocking on the door—a rather comical situation.

Still, if you could witness someone stringing words together, crafting poetry as it’s being born, it would be quite a spectacle. Honestly, I feel like I’d be willing to embarrass myself for the sake of being the subject of such a display. It seems like it would be easier to do this with song lyrics or ad copy rather than something as free-form as poetry.

On TV, Daigo from Chidori did a show where he tackled elementary school math problems in his own unique way, and it was incredibly entertaining. Being able to turn the thought process into "expression" is truly remarkable!

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. I wish someone would do a live broadcast while writing a short story.
