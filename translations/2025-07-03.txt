My Journey to Oze  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Finally here, or maybe not quite yet.  
  I'm at the Oze Hinoemata Onsen, just on the doorstep of the Oze I imagined, soaking in one of Japan's hidden hot springs and jotting down these thoughts. Everything is going so smoothly and enjoyably that I joke about turning back now and calling it a day. But that's not the plan—tomorrow, I'll reach the Chozo lodge.

This has been a long journey. For about three months, I've been preparing for this trip to Oze. Since I’ll be walking with a load on my back for at least an hour, I need to ensure my feet don’t ache. In everyday life, it might not be a problem, but this is Oze, after all. After considering the best time to go, the moment has finally come.

The adventure began with a trip to buy shoes and a backpack. I’d already bought and adjusted a pair of shoes once before, and I was cautious in choosing them because my feet are my biggest concern. I’ve even taken them for test walks. As for the backpack, the idea of "carrying everything myself" was a refreshing change. On my usual trips, I tend to minimize what I bring, thinking, "I can find that over there" or "I’ll buy it when I get there." But when staying in a mountain lodge, there are no shops nearby, and instead of loading things into a car, everything has to be carried on my back. Using anything with wheels is forbidden on the trail. I want to bring what I truly need, but the more I carry, the heavier it gets. This trip forced me to seriously consider what’s necessary and what isn’t. After much deliberation, my backpack weighed in at 7.6 kilograms. It looked incredibly heavy, but then I remembered my late beloved dog, Bouillon, who often accompanied me to Kyoto and weighed over 8 kilograms. Thinking of it as lighter than Bouillon made it seem manageable. I reduced the weight by cutting back on snacks and heavy electronics, but I made sure to pack rain gear and trekking poles. Right now, I'm in a cozy little inn, waiting for tomorrow. …It feels kind of nice, doesn’t it, this sense of anticipation?

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Tomorrow, the Oze I've never seen will become the Oze I’ve finally visited.
