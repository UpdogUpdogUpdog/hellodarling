What a privilege it was to witness something so remarkable.  
by Shigesato Itoi

・I watched the recorded episode of NHK's "Professional: The Way of Work," featuring Nizaemon Kataoka. I recorded it because I wanted to see it, and so I did. From the moment the program started until it ended, I felt as though I had been granted the chance to witness something truly profound. I found myself wanting to bow deeply to Nizaemon, a living national treasure, overwhelmed by a feeling I had never experienced before.

These programs often feature extraordinary individuals. I've seen many astounding figures from the world of Kabuki and theater. Yet, watching Nizaemon Kataoka’s episode, with its subtitle "Captivating with Heart, Pursuing Art," filled me with gratitude. His dedication is genuine, like a child eager to learn. He believes in and chases the ideal of Kabuki, approaching his art with strictness, humility, and relentless practice. Importantly, when he's not engaged in his craft, his face softens into a gentle smile. It's impressive—he balances seriousness with a smile. Truly, he is a "national treasure," not a statue but a living, breathing human. Watching with my boss at home, both of us found ourselves bowing in respect to this human national treasure.

・On another note, there's the "Number" interview special with Shohei Ohtani. What an incredible job they’ve done. Ohtani’s attention to detail is astonishing. The interview is a back-and-forth communication, but Ohtani's responses contain shades of nuance, going beyond just strikes and balls to include the subtleties of pitch types and delicate paths.

ーーThe experience felt like a reward from the baseball gods, perhaps...  
"I want to think of it as something to be grateful for, but I can’t just rely on that. I believe I need to practice to attract such things myself," he says. Ohtani's response is remarkable, expressing gratitude without reducing it to mere thanks to the divine. He's trying to find the link between the divine and his grounded self!
