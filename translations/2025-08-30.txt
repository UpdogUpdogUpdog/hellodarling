I'm in a remarkably good mood.

・Being in a good mood is a wonderful thing, and when it's your own mood that's lifted, it's especially delightful. Our meeting retreat at Akagi was both enjoyable and fruitful—honest, thoughtful, sincere, and simply the best. There have been two days recently that I felt were so memorable that I wanted to keep a record of them. That's why I'm in such high spirits. As for the details, I'm not sharing them with anyone yet.

・Now, as I head to the bathroom, I find myself passing by the fridge. Hmm, let's see, I think to myself as I peek into the freezer, browsing for a cheap "ice treat." There are times when I prefer a simple "ice treat" over a full-fledged "ice cream." I pick one up, intending to eat it, but wait, wasn't I on my way to the bathroom? Should I go there first and enjoy the ice treat afterward? No, I decide, the bathroom can wait—let's have the ice treat now. These two impulses clash back and forth like alternating currents, and each time, the conclusion is different. Yes, I do this kind of thing all the time. In about a 70 to 30 ratio, the decision to eat right away usually wins. It's not that I disregard the bathroom; I just find it amusing—and not entirely unpleasant—to eat the ice treat quickly while holding on for a bit.

・On an entirely different note, organizations sometimes create a "fictitious enemy" to boost solidarity or to gloss over internal tensions. I believe this is a terrible practice. If an organization starts talking about an "overwhelming enemy that must be crushed," it might be wise to question its internal dynamics. Although this is a very traditional tactic, surprisingly many people get caught up in fervently attacking a "fictitious enemy." It's nothing to boast about, but at "Hobonichi," we’ve never created or fought against a "fictitious enemy."

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today.  
It's Saturday. Long ago, Saturdays were half-days, with the afternoon off.
