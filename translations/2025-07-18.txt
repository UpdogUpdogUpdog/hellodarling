The Enigma, Elegance, and Reality of Cicadas  
by Shigesato Itoi

・I have a fondness for watching cicadas emerge. It might sound like a school kid's summer project, but every year, I go to observe as cicada nymphs, having lived underground for years, crawl out to shed their skins on tree trunks. It feels like, "Ah, finally, the moment has come." I visit the same park annually just for this spectacle. This year, I took what I called a "location scouting" trip to check it out. The cicadas emerging were about half the size of what you'd expect—these were the Niini cicadas. While I haven't yet heard their calls around Tokyo, they are undoubtedly emerging. Somewhere, they must be sipping sap and chirping their distinct "niini" song.

There's a certain sadness associated with cicadas, stemming from the "knowledge" that after spending seven years underground as nymphs, they emerge into the light only to die within a week. However, recent studies suggest their life above ground spans more than a week, possibly living over a month.

Moreover, the time they spend as nymphs underground isn't necessarily seven years for Japanese cicadas. Depending on the species, it might be one to two years, three to four, or four to five. In America, there are even 13-year and 17-year cicadas, which makes me want to exclaim, "How long is that!" In any case, while their time above ground is short, their life underground is quite lengthy, so perhaps we can consider them long-lived insects. Compared to a human infant still learning to toddle, the cicada nymph has already accumulated quite a few years. Calling them "ephemeral" seems like imposing human values onto them.

Despite this annual "cicada watching" being a tradition, I've only recently noticed something new. As I watch this year's cicadas emerge from the soil, I realize that beneath the very same tree roots lie the nymphs destined to emerge next year. And perhaps even those for the year after...!

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. In about half a month, the Abura cicadas will appear, followed by the Minmin cicadas.
