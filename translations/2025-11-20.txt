Connections and Distance.  
Shigesato Itoi

・Let's dive into something a bit risky from the start.  
To everyone reading this, I should confess—I’m not telling you everything here. It’s not that I’m deliberately lying. I don’t think I'm telling many lies, if any. But neither am I being entirely forthright.

After all, no matter how much trust one claims to have, I can't see the faces of those reading this. Some may think ill of me, and others might even be plotting against me. There’s also the chance that something I say carelessly could hurt someone. I manage to write every day by gauging what feels safe enough to share, only putting those thoughts into words. It’s akin to how politicians cautiously consider the "safe zone" when discussing sensitive matters. Ordinary people, too, have their own "safe zones."

Yet, what one ponders alone in their mind is, in a sense, limitless and unrestrained, even if it's kept silent. Talking with one or two very close people often allows more freedom. While you might not tell a hundred people something, it could be okay to share with three. Moreover, there are things you might tell these two people but not those other two.

Everything comes down to "connections and distance." If you misjudge these or if they are forcibly altered, things can break. Issues like breaches of privacy stem from this problem. In an era where the internet has reached unprecedented levels of development, conversations meant for close relationships or short distances can easily end up on a public media platform, like a vast bulletin board for the world to see. Everyone has to be cautious about this.

However, what you think about alone is unhindered. It’s best to indulge in strange, preferred thoughts freely. Without this freedom, humans risk becoming mere imitations of AI.

Even the art of "biting wit" relies on managing connections and distance.
