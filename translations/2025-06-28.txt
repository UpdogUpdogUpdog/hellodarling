Japan’s Overwhelming Cultural Edge  
Shigesato Itoi

・There's been talk in sports circles that Japanese baseball is becoming a mere subsidiary of American baseball. But if you look at it from another perspective, it means that a growing number of Japanese players are finally making their mark in the U.S., the heart of the sport. While baseball has reached this point, music is a different story. People say Korean music is dominating the global market, but realistically, they're just holding their own. In Japan’s music industry, even making it onto the world charts is a big deal. Whether it's sports or music, the depth of history, the market scale, the number of players, and the opportunities for education and practice are all different. It's not easy to become a competitor just like that.

However, there's a cultural arena where Japan holds an overwhelming advantage, unmatched by the U.S. or any other country. Video games? Maybe, but other countries have a strong foothold too. Anime? Japan is a formidable contender there as well. Kabuki? Noh? Those are cultural arts without direct competitors. Hospitality? That's good, but not quite what I mean. You know what I’m talking about—manga. While digital media is on the rise, where else in the world can you find such a massive volume of manga magazines? Historically and market-wise, Japan has an abundance of manga, and people are genuinely reading and consuming it. And here’s the crucial part: there are countless people with the skills to create manga. Just as Brazilian kids are naturally skilled at soccer, Japan has a wealth of individuals who can produce manga. There's a vast array of manga, covering every conceivable style and genre, from serious to comedic, expertly drawn to roughly sketched, existing like a sprawling archipelago. Japan's dominance in manga surpasses that of any major nation in sports like baseball or football. For the foreseeable future, no country is likely to catch up to Japan in this field. So what should we do with this immense "potential" of manga?

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nikkan” again today. The number of people who say, "I don't read books, but I read manga" is staggering!
