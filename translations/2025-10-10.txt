A Journal of Being a Mess  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Every year, as this season rolls around, I find myself vaguely unwell, much to the annoyance of those around me. People probably want to ask, "So, when are you going to get better?" Honestly, I have no idea; I'd love to feel better myself. Back in the day, when terms like "allergic rhinitis" or "cold allergy" weren't commonly known, I used to struggle with a runny nose and cough every winter. At home and school, I was labeled as "the one who catches colds easily," a reputation no one wants. Moreover, I was also known as "the one whose colds take forever to heal." No matter how sweltering summer gets, I'd still take it over winter, thanks to these "cold-like symptoms." Despite feeling unwell, I manage to get by, which means I don't really get much sympathy or kindness from others. It's a bit disappointing, but that's just how it is.

By the way, when it comes to this issue, please refrain from offering guesses about the cause or recommending treatments. I appreciate the kindness, but having people speculate, advise, or even deliver lectures can be overwhelming for an already fragile spirit. Some might even say, "If it's such a problem, why write about it?" To them, I can only say, I'm sorry, truly sorry, endlessly sorry.

When I'm "unwell," my mindset turns negative, leading to dissatisfaction with myself, others, and the world at large. I'm more likely to notice flaws than good points. I'm aware of this tendency, so I warn those around me in advance: "I might come across like a mean stepmother in a drama, being harsh about this or that." I ask them to take my words with a grain of salt. Looking back, I might just be the most bothersome person of the year right now—sorry, sorry.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. What do you think? If I wrote stuff like this every day, people would surely start to dislike me.
