Everything is becoming hyper-specialized.  
Shigesato Itoi

・Every aspect of life is being "specialized."  
  The research and efforts of those who came before us have accumulated,  
  creating a foundation of what was already deeply explored.  
  New researchers build upon this foundation,  
  delving even deeper into their subjects.  
  Whether it be Nobel-level research or fanatical knowledge in specific fields,  
  the trend towards specialization seems inevitable.

I once heard from someone studying the brain that even within "brain research,"  
depending on which part and what aspect you focus on,  
researchers in other areas might not be able to keep up.  
In the future, as AI continues to specialize this knowledge further,  
many fields of study will likely become enshrined in black boxes.

There used to be a class called "structure" in driving school,  
where we learned about engines, intake compression, explosion, and exhaust.  
But it seems they don't teach that anymore.  
Even if you have some structural knowledge, you can't really fix anything.  
And when a smartphone breaks, no one thinks to open it up and repair it;  
you just get a new one instead.

In such an era, people who might not have specialized knowledge themselves  
but can map out where to find it or who the relevant experts are  
will become increasingly important.  
This has been said since the early 1990s.  
It's the role of "knowledge people."  
Even now, in 2025, I feel this acutely.  
Neither broad knowledge nor pretending to know can compete with AI,  
so in this age of specialization, what should we learn?  
This is a fundamental question for humanity.

I can't help but marvel at Drucker's foresight.
