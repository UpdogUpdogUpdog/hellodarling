Personal Matters and the Lives of Others  
Shigesato Itoi

In "Tora-san, Our Lovable Tramp," there's a classic line: "In short, do I eat the yam, and you break wind?" It's spot on, isn't it? We're connected to others, yet we're not the same.

Lately, I've noticed a lot of talk about whether we perceive things as "personal matters." I try to adopt this perspective myself, often bringing it up with my colleagues. The opposite of a "personal matter" is "someone else's matter." We might think, "Wow, that's tough," but most things just drift past us as "someone else's problem."

I had a vague memory and decided to look it up again: "In 2024, Las Vegas, USA, hit a scorching 48.3 degrees Celsius." Did you know that? It's true. Death Valley even reached 54 degrees. Not Fahrenheit, but Celsius. While we're here in Japan, freaking out about surpassing 40 degrees and feeling like it's a personal crisis, the 48 degrees in America felt like "someone else's matter." This year, even Paris, France, recorded 42 degrees. The heat in Japan feels personal, but elsewhere, it's just "someone else's matter." That's human nature, really. It's not about right or wrong; it's just how it is.

Today, I'm heading west from Tokyo Station. I've already sent off my big luggage, preparing for a few days of summer vacation. I was thinking, "Wow, Kyushu is really getting hit hard with rain." Even the Sanyo Shinkansen has stoppedâ€”what a situation. I watched the news about the damage as "someone else's problem." But then, I heard, "The Tokaido Shinkansen is also suspending operations..." Suddenly, I'm like, "Wait, what's going to happen?" I find myself scrambling to understand and investigate the rain bands as if they're my personal concern, though I must admit it's a bit selfish. So, what will happen with this "personal matter"?
