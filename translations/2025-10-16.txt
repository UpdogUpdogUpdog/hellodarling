Numbers I've Arbitrarily Decided.

Shigesato Itoi

・I try to avoid thinking in numbers as much as possible. It's convenient to express everything in numbers, to analyze and quantify, but getting too caught up in that isn't really suited for humans. Yet, despite this belief, I often find myself using numbers as a kind of mental image. Of course, there's no scientific basis for it—it's just what I think. By "I," I mean myself, Itoi, as an individual (this is not a viewpoint representing any organization I might belong to).

One of these numbers is the age at which I consider someone to become an adult. For a long time, adulthood was marked at 20. Now, I hear the rule has been bent to accommodate 18. However, in my view, true adulthood begins at 30. Even at 29, you're still not quite there. You're not exactly a child as you approach 30, but you're not a full-fledged adult either. Given that life expectancy has increased and the foundational learning for living has become more complicated in modern times, I believe that it's not until 30 that one truly becomes an adult.

Next, when it comes to the age at which people start aging, I place this at 65. At 60, I still see people as ordinary adults. In your 40s and 50s, you're still young—keep pushing yourself. However, by the time you reach 65, it's reasonable to acknowledge becoming an elder. It’s an age when you begin to live in tandem with doctors and exercise. You live by managing yourself as an adult who might lack something. From 65 onward, you’re an elder; before that, you’re not.

Another point, which I once heard from Yasuhan Kyu, is something I find quite convincing: "If you have about a million yen a month, you can live without much discomfort." I'm aware there are a variety of opinions on this, and that circumstances vary by time, situation, and environment, but after considering everything, I think this is a reasonable conclusion. As a bonus thought, I believe that having 30,000 yen in your wallet is generally enough to get by in most situations.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. Also, there's the notion that men tend to face significant challenges around the age of 40.
