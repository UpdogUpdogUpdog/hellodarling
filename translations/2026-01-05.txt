I had completely forgotten about all that.

・Time flies. We truly experience so much every day, yet we live by forgetting most of it.

How did we live during those pandemic days? For example, how often did we go to the office? How did we eat, and how did we work? How did we shop for things? Sometimes, I can recall fragments, like the image of Omotesando in the middle of the city, void of cars and people. I remember taking my dog for a walk and having the street all to myself. Was that really how it was? When exactly was that, and for how long? I have no memory of what the other streets were like. My iPhone still has photos from that time, and when I checked, there were more pictures of "Takeout Available" signs than of the scenery. Even though "Hobonichi" switched to remote work, it's surprising I didn't get on my boss's bad side after being home for so long.

Yet, I have more vivid memories of the Great East Japan Earthquake, which happened almost a decade earlier. The elevator hall lights were dimmed to save electricity in Tokyo. Even now, walking through the old apartment building, I remember just how dark it was then. I recall a lot about Tokyo and the Tohoku region during that time. It makes me realize how much I've forgotten about the long pandemic period. Surprisingly, I haven't forgotten the serious thoughts I had as a "president," pondering "What will happen next?" The memories of thinking, contemplating, and joining forces with others remain vivid.

Interestingly, no matter which photos I search for, most are of my beloved dog or my granddaughter's daily life. The dog has grown up, and the granddaughter is now a young girl.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. It was all about practicing how to think things through rather than worrying.
