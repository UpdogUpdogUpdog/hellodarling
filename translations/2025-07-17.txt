I always tread carefully around yelling and tears.  
Shigesato Itoi

・It's fascinating how the same words can convey entirely different feelings depending on their delivery. For instance, saying "I can't trust him" carries a strong implication. If you say it angrily, it will sound as though you genuinely mean it. But if you utter "I can't trust him" in a calm, quiet voice, it gives off a different vibe, though the sentiment remains. And if you were to say the same words while smirking, it might come across as a joke or even condescending. On the other hand, if you say "I can't trust him" while crying, it would likely sound quite earnest.

The phrase "I can't trust him" is the same in every instance, yet the way it's expressed changes its impact. When emotions are infused—whether through anger or tears—it tends to come across as sincere, as if spoken from the heart. Those of you reading this might nod along, thinking, "Well, of course." But the important part is what comes next.

That's why people who intend to deceive often resort to anger or tears. If someone is yelling, "How dare you doubt me!" or "You're the one who's lying!" with explosive anger, or if someone is crying, "I've been deceived!"—a passerby or someone unfamiliar with the situation might immediately sympathize with the one expressing such intense emotions. They might think, "They must be serious, given how angry they are," or "They must be genuine, given how much they're crying." Such emotional outbursts carry that kind of power. However, those trying to deceive often exploit these expressive techniques. We should be wary of "yelling," "shouting," "sobbing," and "tears." These days, the shouting from all directions is exhausting.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" again today. I hope to be someone whose anger is trusted when it's genuine.
