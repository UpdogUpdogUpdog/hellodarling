Eating a Sandwich in the Middle of the Night  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Legend has it that the sandwich was invented by a certain Earl of Sandwich, who wanted a meal he could eat with one hand while playing cards. He supposedly put something between slices of bread to achieve this. But, I have my doubts. I haven’t researched it, but stories like this are usually made up. I bet people were putting stuff between bread long before any earl or duke showed up in history. Still, if the sandwich isn’t named after a person, then how did it get its name? I have no idea. I didn’t do anything; it just naturally ended up that way. Honestly, we probably don’t know the origins of most nouns.

Yet, almost everyone who knows sandwiches knows the tale of the "Earl of Sandwich" and assumes it’s the true origin. Take Archimedes’ principle, for example. The story goes that he shouted “Eureka!” and ran out of his bath naked, but I doubt it happened like that. Not that Archimedes ever denied it, so the whole world just accepted the image of him running around in the buff. And then there’s “Newton’s apple.” There are so many variations of the story that they even specify the type of apple that fell. We can’t ask Newton, “Did it really happen?” anymore. Yet, worldwide, when you think of Newton, you think of apples. There's also “Columbus’ egg” and in Japan, we have “Mōri Motonari’s three arrows” and “Kinoshita Tōkichirō’s sandals” (which became a great story in ‘The Brothers Toyotomi!’).

So, I’ve mentioned a few things that came to mind, but whether these stories are true or false doesn’t really matter. They are legends that have become “classics” passed down through generations. I realized that each of these legends is like a “perfect poster.”

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nikkan” today.  
Legends are “stories,” but they’re also like a single, vivid poster.
