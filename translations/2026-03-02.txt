The Thing About Heat  
Shigesato Itoi

・I found myself wondering—well, I often find myself wondering—if people might think too highly of "heat."

They say things like he's got a fire in his heart, they felt his passion, don't forget that burning intensity, it's a fiery love... All of it sounds good, it sounds fine, I agree. Up until the point where it's "thought too highly of," it's fine. "It's good to be passionate," sure, why not? But if you really think about it, you'll realize that while being "hot" is great for a short while, being perpetually and endlessly "hot" isn't ideal. A fiery protagonist is fine in a drama because you part ways after an hour, but if that intensity follows you home, it gets troublesome. Imagine someone declaring, "I'm on fire!" at the dinner table.

Even when cooking rice, you turn up the heat until it boils. Once it starts bubbling, you lower the heat to a minimum for ten minutes. Depending on the method, you might even turn the heat off altogether. There's no "I'm on fire!" moment here. Then you let it steam and finally transfer it to a rice container.

I have a fondness for anmitsu, so I often make agar jelly. Of course, you boil the agar in water, but if you don't let it cool, it won't become jelly. Eventually, you even cool it below room temperature before eating.

I started thinking that work, relationships, and any kind of discipline might be the same. You shouldn't try to keep "heat" at its peak the whole time. It seems appealing, but that's not how things work. The management of various temperatures—"hot," "warm," "lukewarm," and "cold"—is necessary. After attending a great seminar, I thought, I need to be careful of getting "too hot." Honestly, I've never been good with "heat" to begin with.
