・I'm here now.  
  Because there's a rakugo performance happening.  
  It's delightful to see how it's been passed down from "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" to the locals and continues so vibrantly.  
  As an audience member, I relish the splendid storytelling from the stage.  
  Before the rakugo begins, some relatively new crew members from "Hobo Nikkan" will hear the locals of Kesennuma narrate the "History of the Kesennuma Sanma Yose" in a relay format. I'd love to hear that.  
  Ah, rakugo, Shinosuke, Kesennuma—how wonderful!

  Now, changing the topic.  
  Recently, I heard about "extensive reading and listening" from someone I met.  
  It's a method for learning foreign languages (I think mainly English).  
  You start by reading lots of simple English books that you can understand without a dictionary.  
  If there are parts you don't get, it's fine to leave them unclear; you just keep reading without translating everything into Japanese.  
  Gradually, you move on to more advanced books.  
  If you don't enjoy it, you can stop reading.  
  By reading extensively in English, step by step, you naturally progress.  
  When the books become more challenging, it's okay to use a dictionary, but it should be an English-English dictionary.  
  I just recently heard about this, so I'm passing it on, but I'm really intrigued by it.  
  I believe this "extensive reading and listening" approach mirrors how humans learn their native language, from infancy to adulthood.  
  A baby can only use words they understand, like "mama," "food," or "over there," no matter how much adults talk to them.  
  Eventually, they start to grasp unfamiliar words and can use them.  
  Even as adults, we skim over words or expressions we don't know, thinking we've "read" the text.  
  Following this path from baby to bookworm in English, I feel confident we can truly acquire language.  
  It would be great if we could offer lessons on this at the gates of Hobonichi School.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
Children speak quite proficient Japanese without using a dictionary.
