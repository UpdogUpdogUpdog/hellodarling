City dwellers too accustomed to cramped spaces.  
Shigesato Itoi

・I embarked on my journey with a large backpack, and while the memory of it was still fresh, I visited a grave in Kyoto, snatched a brief rest in Tokyo, and then dashed off to the Osaka Expo. Quite the energetic schedule for someone in their later years.

・As I gazed at the calendar, I thought maybe I’d take a break once these three plans were done. But, naturally, things never go as planned. There are still those tasks I keep saying I'll get to but haven’t started. It’s about time I tackle those assignments. Of course, I’ll do them—I’ll enjoy doing them.

・While moving from place to place, a thought keeps resurfacing: Tokyo is desperately lacking in "space." And it's not just Tokyo—it's all big cities. Homes, hotels, shops, offices—everything feels cramped. It's understandable, though. The average land price in Tokyo’s 23 wards is 2.3 million yen per tsubo. Renting, let alone buying, comes at an outrageous cost. In such places, dreaming of spacious plans feels impossible. The likes of Hibiya Park or Shinjuku Gyoen now seem almost miraculous. In contrast, and depending on the region, the countryside offers ample "space." Even if it's pointless to bring up a national park like Oze, that boundless nature is beyond any human scope. 

Across Japan, in any rural area, there are vast spaces that match the sky’s expanse. There are places where city people, so used to tight spaces, can regain their "sense of vastness." Come to think of it, the allure of the Osaka Expo lies in how its grand roof ring showcases "space." While a smartphone screen can hold endless information, it risks trapping human perception within its confines. That’s something I find distasteful, and lately, I feel the scarcity of "space" more acutely.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. After all, we don’t live on information alone.
