On the Subject of Not Needing Definitions  
by Shigesato Itoi

・When you're embroiled in legal or scientific debates, definitions might be crucial. But when you're setting out on a new venture, I think it's best not to get too caught up in defining everything.

What exactly is ○○?  
What falls under the category of ○○?  
What conditions must be met for something to be considered ○○?  
Even if you exhaustively discuss these questions, what is truly gained? Instead, if you just keep in mind the one thing you absolutely must avoid, you likely won't end up in a bad place. Sure, without strict definitions, you might stray off course or take the long way around. There might be more failures and wasted efforts. Yet, amid what seem like setbacks, you'll find much to learn and accumulate as experience. And who knows, chance and fortune might just find their way to you. From beyond the boundaries of definitions and conventions, unexpected combinations and possibilities can emerge.

At "Hobonichi," we weren't fixated on definitions either. It may sound utterly unorthodox, but when we started creating, I remember telling everyone to stop buying samples and trying to "study" them. What is a planner? What's the definition of a planner? If we had seriously debated these questions, we would have ended up with something either too similar to existing products, slightly inferior, or at best, marginally better. That was precisely what we wanted to avoid. We began with a rather frivolous attitude, thinking, "Can't we create a cooler planner?" Because of this, we encountered numerous possibilities and were able to absorb a wide range of ideas and aspirations.

The heated debates you see in the media are the business of those who thrive on that sort of thing. But when it comes to actually "doing" something, definitions aren't necessary.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. Luck tends to fall through the cracks and open spaces, doesn't it?
