The Story of Itoi's Retreat  
Shigesato Itoi

On June 6th, "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" officially became "Hobo Nikkan." I doubt anyone noticed this subtle shift, but with this change in title, the word "Itoi" quietly disappeared. Originally, "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" meant "The Almost Daily Itoi Newspaper," but now it simply reads "Hobo Nikkan." Honestly, this makes me incredibly happy.

When we first came up with the name "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun," I consulted with Mr. Iwata. He suggested, "It might be good for people to know it's your page, Mr. Itoi," which is why the three characters for Itoi were included. It also carried the nuance of "written by Itoi." We commissioned Katsunori Aoki to design the newspaper's logo, and the publication launched in 1998. Back then, I anticipated that, eventually, people would naturally abbreviate it to "Hobo Nikkan." I thought, the day people start calling it just "Hobo Nikkan" without a second thought, that's when it will truly have gained its place in the world. After all, even the Sankei Shimbun was once the "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun," and sports papers like Nikkan, Sponichi, and Tokyo Sports are all known by their abbreviated names. I hoped for something similar 28 years ago.

And look, that's exactly what happened. Itoi stepping back was always my intention, and gradually, we prepared for it until it became reality. Moreover, no one has questioned, "Is it really okay for Itoi to disappear?" I don't feel the slightest bit lonely about it. I think it's remarkable how seamlessly this change occurred. It's a testament to how well everyone at "Hobo Nikkan" has done their work. I'm still aboard the "Hobo Nikkan" ship, but at the very least, we've successfully changed the nameplate.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Sometimes, people even ask, "Oh, was Itoi involved with Hobo Nikkan?"
