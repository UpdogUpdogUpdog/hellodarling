The majority of the universe exists beyond words.

・If we were to compare Earth's history to a 24-hour clock,  
  the emergence of Homo sapiens, our ancestors, would happen at around 23:59:56.  
  It's a staggering thought, yet we often imagine in our minds  
  that the Nara period and the construction of the pyramids happened long ago,  
  with humanity's birth even further back, and dinosaurs further still...  
  But really, when we try to picture this timeline,  
  it's just not something you can compare in any meaningful way.

  We often say poetically, "as numerous as the stars,"  
  but the stars visible to the naked eye aren't that many.  
  Or like the saying, "Even if the sands of the shore are exhausted,  
  the seeds of thieves will never perish."  
  It's meant to convey an incalculable number,  
  but upon reflection, it feels like no big deal.  
  Even the sands on the shore could be counted, if one tried hard enough.  
  I've been thinking about this kind of thing for a while now...

  Recently, I started pondering how much "language" there is  
  in the entire universe (or at least on Earth).  
  Not systematic "languages" like Japanese or Greek,  
  but the total "vocabulary"—like grains of sand, adding up all the "words."  
  I was playing around with AI, discussing this.  
  Even when limited to dictionary entries,  
  each language has hundreds of thousands of words,  
  and there are roughly 7,000 languages, it seems.  
  So we're talking tens of millions, maybe even a hundred million or two.  
  Plus, new words can be created all the time, making it infinite.  
  It's an undeniably "large number," even from AI's perspective.  
  But with the "Earth's clock" analogy, I realized something.  
  No matter how many millions or billions,  
  the number of words since humans came into being is trivial! (In a tone like Goro from Blackboard Jungle).  
  Whether artificial or natural, the things and events  
  not yet put into words are overwhelmingly more numerous.  
  Words can never fully encompass "reality."  
  They merely sketch a small part of it with a limited palette.  
  Well, I suppose this is also just my wordplay.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today.  
One could say, don't boast as a human, and don't boast as words, either.
