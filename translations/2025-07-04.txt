Ah, so this is the feeling you get when you arrive at Oze.
Shigesato Itoi

・It’s wonderful, truly. Now I get why everyone who comes here even once can’t stop saying, “It’s amazing!” Sure, before you arrive, it’s a hassle, no doubt about it. You start from buying the right shoes. A backpack, rain gear, snacks for the road—you need them all. Then, you take the Shinkansen from Tokyo, get off at Nasushiobara Station, rent a car from there, spend a night at a hot spring inn in Hinoemata Village, and the next morning, drive to a place called Oike. You leave the car there, switch to an electric bus, and finally, you arrive at Numayama Pass. You get off the bus and start walking.

As you walk along the slightly undulating wooden path, a dreamlike world unfolds before you, whispering, “This is Oze.” At that moment, you can't even think of being tired; a burst of joy overtakes you. It’s then you realize all the preparations were for this. Let's go, let's keep moving, taking breaks along the way. Are we a group of angels, floating along? Ah, I see a glimmer of water; is that Oze Lake? In about an hour, we reached Chozogoya Lodge.

Everyone's faces are already saying, “That was wonderful,” without needing to speak. Even without asking, you can feel their delight. We passed by high school girls, elderly couples, and even a group of first graders—adorable. I didn’t boast about being 76, just greeted them warmly.

Chozogoya Lodge—I can’t help but add “san” out of respect—is incredible. I’m impressed that, in an area preserved without roads or cars, there’s a building where you can stay comfortably. And it’s so well-maintained. Nowadays, “service” is often thought to be about receiving meticulous hospitality, but this is a completely different approach. How can everyone enjoy themselves comfortably? They must have explored and implemented ways to make it happen. There’s so much "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" can learn from this and contribute to. I’m already writing this piece while there’s still daylight.

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun” today. Spending an afternoon listening to the rain while indoors—what a perfect gift.
