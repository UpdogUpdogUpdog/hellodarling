Without a Big Screen Monitor  
Shigesato Itoi

・I'm not really fond of rooms without windows. I like having a glass window that connects the room to the outside world. In the same vein, I find that purely visual information on a smartphone or computer screen feels somewhat lacking. Ideally, I want a big screen monitor in the room. Maybe it’s because I’m a person from the Showa era.

Last weekend, I had to stay at home for certain reasons. I had planned everything in advance for that. Watching a movie was a definite—"Phantom Thread" was the choice. I had seen "One Battle After Another" at the theater, and it was so phenomenal that I decided to watch all the works by this director. Only two were left, including this one. Honestly, Paul Thomas Anderson is someone you could rightfully call a “genius.” It’s astonishing. The other film was "John Lennon: The Lost Weekend," something I had been meaning to watch but kept putting off. Afterward, I listened to John’s album "Rock 'n' Roll" and "Pussy Cats," which he made with Harry Nilsson.

Between the two films, I binge-watched Netflix. The show was a romantic reality series called "Love Is Okay." So far, seven episodes were available, and I planned to watch them all at once. The previous series, "Ai no Sato," featured middle-aged contestants, but this time, the so-called “former delinquents” took center stage. In the first episode, which heavily focuses on introducing the participants, everyone is posturing and putting up a front, but as you get to know them, you start feeling closer to them. At the same time, as viewers, we learn about them and gradually warm up to their personalities, making us eager to see what happens next.

On top of that, the "M-1 Grand Prix" finals were on Sunday. Of course, I watched it—congratulations to "Takurou."

In just over two days, you wouldn’t believe how much that big screen monitor proved its worth! If it weren’t for the large screen on the wall, I probably wouldn’t have watched all that. No matter what happens to TV, big screens might be eternal, don’t you think? Is this just a Showa-era person’s perspective?

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. It feels like I had a rehearsal for the year-end and New Year’s holidays. My back hurts.
