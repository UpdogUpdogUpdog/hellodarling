Courage seems to be in short supply these days.

・It might not be such a good idea to be overly cautious. Lately, it feels like there's just too much of that going around.

I apologize for using a baseball analogy again, but there’s often this expectation for players to do the bare minimum. Wanting a home run or a hit is something only amateurs think about. To really increase our chances for the next play, we demand a sacrifice fly, even if it results in an out (sorry to those who don’t follow baseball). It’s about weighing all the options and picking the one with the least chance of failure, even if it just leaves us with the bare minimum possibility. The goal becomes avoiding failure at any cost. But this way, while you’re unlikely to lose, you’re also unlikely to win big. Essentially, it boils down to being "average and error-free." This means you end up practicing to be "error-free" every single day. It sounds logical and reasonable.

However, if you’re always thinking about being "error-free" and constantly training to avoid mistakes, something inevitably gets lost.

One of those things might be "courage." And "courage" is made from the raw material of "belief." Even when you know the odds are against you, deciding that you can do it requires "courage." In fact, every "decision" involves some "courage." After all, taking no action often seems like the safer bet.

Being overly cautious is a method that doesn’t rely on "courage." I’m not saying it’s okay to take unnecessary risks. Even when being cautious, there comes a point where you have to make the decision, "this is my responsibility." And that requires "courage."

To reiterate, the raw material of "courage" is "belief," which is closely tied to "faith," and beyond that, it connects to "hope."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. It might sound like I’m speaking to the Giants, but really, I’m talking to myself.
