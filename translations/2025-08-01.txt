Two recommendations for embracing a carefree style.

・I had a conversation with director Lee Sang-il, whose film is a major hit right now. It'll probably be published on "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" around September. We talked for a full ninety minutes, and it was absolutely fascinating. I won't go into details here, but we did touch on his previous two films, both based on Shūichi Yoshida's works, "Villain" and "Rage." After seeing "Hula Girls," I hadn't watched these two films by Director Lee, but the release of "National Treasure" prompted me to watch them back-to-back. What I want to say is quite simple: if you enjoyed "National Treasure," you should definitely check out "Villain" and "Rage." Now, I know many people have already seen them, but for those who haven't, watching them now might make "National Treasure" even more enjoyable. And since I'm not exactly a film expert, feel free to watch with a hint of skepticism, thinking, "Really, though?"

・Here's another tidbit that might make you think, "Seriously?" The author of "Starting with Issues" and "New Japan," has released a new book titled, just recently published. It spans an impressive 984 pages and weighs about a kilogram. Priced at 5,500 yen, it isn't exactly cheap. I have two copies—one a gift and the other pre-ordered. The catch is, I haven't started reading it yet. Even so, I knew the author, Ataku, had been working on this book. I also knew he frequently drove to and from a place called "Valley of the Wind," as suggested by the book's title, and the phrase on the cover, "Is urban concentration inevitable for humanity?" intrigued me. Despite not having read it yet, I'm certain I'll dive into it and discuss it with others who have read it. This certainty remains, even without reading it. There's something significant about this book being released in the year of the Osaka-Kansai Expo. I suggest you keep it on your radar too.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Are we all climbing the same mountain from different paths?
