It's Not Hard, and I Don't Need It  
Shigesato Itoi

・I have an allergy to shrimp and crab, so I live without eating either. Every now and then, a bit sneaks into my food, and I end up chewing on it for a moment. In those instances, I deal with it immediately. If I have my allergy medication on hand, I take it right away. But the odd part is my initial reaction when I realize I've eaten shrimp or crab: "What is this delicious thing?! It's shrimp!" Despite being allergic, it seems I absolutely love the taste. However, not being able to eat something I apparently adore isn't painful at all. Even when those around me are enjoying shrimp, crab, or lobster with great relish, I'm not envious or bothered in the least. On the contrary, I'm glad they're enjoying it, and I even smile as a kind neighbor would. It's true, that's just how it is.

A similar thing applies to alcohol. I don't indulge in alcoholic beverages, and honestly, I'm not too disappointed about it. It's simply a matter of not needing it. There might have been times when I said, "It'd be nice to drink at a time like this," when faced with a dish that pairs well with alcohol, but I've never truly meant it. Really, it doesn't matter to me either way. I've met people who insist it's a shame I can't drink, or that I'm missing out on a major pleasure in life, but I don't feel that way, so it doesn't bother me at all. It's not that I'm cold or don't recognize the value of alcohol. I'm fine just as I am.

I think that things I've never needed up until now are unlikely to become necessities. If I want something, I'll want it in my own way.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today. The feeling of "I want what I want" is always there.
