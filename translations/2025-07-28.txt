No matter what, we're all just human.  
Shigesato Itoi

・People have a way of saying things that sound entirely reasonable, but are just lip service.  
   Well, humans have been doing this forever.  
   I'm a man, I'm human, so of course I've done it too.  
   It's the kind of thing everyone can only nod in agreement to,  
   an argument so airtight there's no room for dissent,  
   and yet it’s expressed so gently without a hint of self-righteousness.  
   Such seemingly sensible words need to be handled with care.  
   Truly believing in them is what matters.  
   "Love thy neighbor"—what a wonderful phrase.  
   "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"  
   or "Do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself"—  
   these are timeless words that have been spoken since ancient times.

   But I imagine even con artists use phrases like these.  
   They wouldn't start off by saying something that sounds deceitful.  
   They begin with something that seems "good,"  
   drawing you in with mutual agreement, and then lead you astray.  
   Given how familiar people have become with these tactics,  
   there are those who use the opposite approach,  
   employing "blunt honesty" and "straight talk" to make you believe,  
   "This person is trustworthy because they're honest."  
   Once you start doubting, there's no end to it,  
   yet those seemingly sensible words are still necessary.  
   It’s tough to live up to them, but  
   having "a vital phrase to hold in your heart" is important,  
   even if con artists might exploit it.

   And then, once in a while, something that seems entirely sensible emerges from within yourself.  
   I think these are things not so much to tell others,  
   but rather to jot down as a note to oneself.  
   So, I really did make a note, and decided to write it here too.  
   "Every human is just human.  
   Not a demon, not an object,  
   and certainly not a number."  
   There are times we see others as demons, objects, or mere numbers.  
   Precisely because this happens often, I want to keep it in mind.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today.  
Well, it's definitely easier to deal with demons, objects, or numbers.
