Doesn't everyone have a "kokoro"?

From childhood, I've mulled over it, sometimes seriously, other times not at all. There were moments I cherished it deeply, and others when I coldly questioned its existence. This elusive thing we call "kokoro."

If someone were to ask where exactly this "kokoro" resides, people might place a hand over their heart or point to their head, suggesting it's nestled within the brain. Yet, if pressed further, it's unlikely anyone could answer with absolute certainty. Much like how we rarely acknowledge the air we breathe, though it's undeniably there, we live assuming the presence of "kokoro." To claim it doesn't exist is even harder to explain. After all, when someone dies, it's evident that their "kokoro" ceases to be. While we're alive, perhaps not unlike Descartes' "I think, therefore I am," our "kokoro" is constantly at work, pondering.

As I write these words, it's my "kokoro" at play, and as you read them, it's your "kokoro" engaging. We're both alive, and thus these words are penned and read. Here, between us, the exchange of "kokoro" has taken place.

Though we can't display the "kokoro" itself, we can certainly show the traces it leaves behind. A warm smile is a glimpse of its movement. Spoken and written words, paintings, calligraphy, dance, song, even running and walking—all are expressions and trails of the "kokoro." Sometimes, the act of writing or dancing or singing can stir the "kokoro" into motion. There are things that might wound the "kokoro" and others that invigorate it. Occasionally, it might even long for a soak in a hot spring.
