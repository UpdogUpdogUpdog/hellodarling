Is the Rice Frenzy Over?  
Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»It seems like overnight, the relentless "Rice, rice, rice!" cries that filled every media outlet have all but vanished. Although I can do some research on my own, when I checked the "average price of rice today," it was about 100 yen cheaper per 5 kilograms than during the height of the hysteria. So, did this 100-yen drop quell the frenzy? Not that I'm saying we should be panicking, but despite the situation remaining quite similar, the volume of news coverage has drastically changed. Everyone jumps on the bandwagon, thinking they can't be the only ones not covering a story, and as a result, we end up with these "trends" that sweep us all along.

In the newspaper industry, if one outlet fails to cover a story that others have, it's called a "scoop miss," and apparently, it's quite embarrassing. This mindset seems to persist even now. When everyone lines up to cover the same news and tries to do it "deeper and more thoroughly" than the others, it can lead to aggressive reporting and overly sensational coverage. I don't think this approach fits the current reality. After all, the "recipients of information" can now find out who didn't cover what, who went into more detail, or who was overly intrusive. There should be room for the "personality" of not covering certain news, or covering it after everyone else has moved on. During the rice frenzy, the angle was that it was a direct hit to the household budget, but now, I think we could handle it more calmly.

If everyone's going to cover the same stories anyway, I'd appreciate it if some outlets took a "we won't just line up" stance. That way, they might even cultivate their own fans. Well, right now, everyone's in a frenzy over the "House of Councillors election," but it wouldn't hurt to shift the focus a bit.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. To be honest, I'm still concerned about rice.
