Taking a Step Back from "Strength"  
Shigesato Itoi

・For boys, at least once or twice, or perhaps even more, there's the thought, "I want to be strong." It's a simple idea—maybe I should try judo or karate—and some actually go ahead and take up karate. "Strength" is a major value for boys, and it might be a wish that carries on into adulthood. There's a "strength" in all things, and just the ability to say, "I'm kind of strong in that area," can be a source of pride.

In truth, we eventually learn that "strength" isn't the only value and we each follow our own path. But if you ask what else there is besides "strength," it's not so easy to find clear alternatives. Being "smart" or "skilled at something" are, when you think about it, just different expressions of "strength." Recently, I came across the term "Shigodeki," which seems to mean "capable at work." That's just another form of "strength," isn't it?

Sure, maybe humanity has evolved that way, but constantly being asked to prove "strength" can be quite a pressure. If you keep living with that mindset, you'll eventually burn out, no matter how strong you are. Oh, are there people who keep running without burning out? Well, they're just pretending to be strong, pretending not to tire. Or maybe they're simply not competing to see who wins, just focusing on what they love and excel at. For those people, doing and resting are one and the same.

Competing over "strength" is one thing, but competing over "weakness" is tough too. When it turns into bragging about "who has it worse" or "who is weaker," it becomes a trap you can't escape. It seems to me that the best way to live is to have plenty of time where you're not comparing yourself to anything else.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Babies, for example, have plenty of time where they're not comparing themselves to anything.
