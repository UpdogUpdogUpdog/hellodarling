Translation:

It was like a digest of life.

April made me think of cherry blossoms, which I had almost forgotten.
Then, my granddaughter started elementary school, carrying a randoseru backpack.
She had friends at nursery school, but it was like a limited world within a dome.
When she entered elementary school, she joined a small society with children from the same region, from first to sixth grade, people she knew and didn't know.
It was no longer a dome, but a small society.
I thought this was a huge change.
She quickly adapted to society and seemed to enjoy herself, which was delightful.

In May, I had more time at home during the Golden Week holidays.
After that, I participated in the "Kanda Festival," a traditional event.
It was a two-day "festival" like a crown marriage funeral festival.
Then, I returned to work, and after a while, I attended a farewell party for Mr. Tanioka.
This could have been a form of "funeral."
Furthermore, my nephew's father passed away, and the funeral continued.
The funeral was accompanied by the music "Sukiyaki," which made me look up.
Three days later, I participated in the "Music Award Japan" in Kyoto.
Although I only appeared for a brief moment as a presenter, it was a musical "festival" and a "crown" event.
I returned to Tokyo, stayed overnight at home, and then headed to Kyoto again.
This time, it was for Ms. Kishida's wedding reception.
It was truly a delightful and joyful "wedding."
The parents of the bride and groom were both magnificent.
I couldn't help but cry several times.
The groom was truly a "good person," and I found a hint about how he became that way.
According to his mother's testimony, even after entering elementary school, he still didn't wean from breast milk; in other words, he still drank breast milk.
Even when friends came to play, he would make them go home and drink his mother's breast milk.
So, if becoming a "good person" like that means not drinking enough breast milk, then I must not have drunk enough breast milk myself.

Today, too, I'm grateful for your visit on this "almost day."
As I was getting drowsy, I realized that it's also the anniversary of the founding of "Almost Day."
