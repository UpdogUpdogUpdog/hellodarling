Indeed, each one is unique in its own way.

・So, here I am, whimsically writing like some kind of fairy tale.

Even among those born to the world of "things that move," there are racing cars. You've got these machines that need a tire change after just a short run, and I've heard those tires cost a fortune. They speed along as if they're flying through the air. Incredible, right? They're at the pinnacle of the "things that move" world. And yet, even at the peak, they're ranked by speed—faster, slower. Exhausting, isn't it? Perhaps it's the fate of something that moves.

On the other hand, there's the humble mamachari, or the tricycle, which have also come into this world as "things that move." A child's tricycle might even be slower than walking. Yet, there's no existential crisis for a tricycle. I doubt it ever contemplates speeding up. Are they even maintained to run better? They might not even get a drop of oil, just squeaking along. The mamachari can be a bit unpredictable though. Some people race them recklessly, heedless of danger. Sometimes, it's the ones with kids on board that are in the biggest hurry. Nowadays, many bikes even come with motors. That's a whole different story from a tricycle.

But still, isn't everyone "unique" in their own way? There's no need to say "everyone's different, and that's good." Racing cars, bicycles, tricycles, trucks—they all seem to have this sense of "I'm fine as I am." Maybe it's because each has its own role or job. A tricycle doesn't envy a racing car. I doubt a mamachari complains to a truck.

However, it's not just "things that move." Mice don't compete with tigers, elephants don't vie with ants, and pandas don't argue with red pandas. Come to think of it, it's only humans who can't just be "unique." Is that a good thing or not? I wonder.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
And humans, well, we say things like "I alone know contentment."
