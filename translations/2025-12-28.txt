Reflecting on the Obituary List for 2025  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Just a few more sleeps until the New Year, and yes, we all know it's four, right? Four more nights, and when we wake, it'll be the next year. I'm looking forward to it.

Yet, it's a bit odd to bring this up now, but here we go. As with every year, 2025 had its share of obituaries. Flipping through the December 23rd edition of "Sports Hochi," I stumbled upon a list of those who passed away this year. Being a sports paper, it's mainly focused on people from the sports and entertainment worlds. Even so, seeing the list, I found myself surprised—"Oh, that person too?" Some names I had forgotten, despite hearing about their passing, while others I was completely unaware of. I guess my surprise and interest stem from the growing possibility that my own name might join these ranks. After all, people who were once "newcomers" or "child actors," shining heroes or figures I admired, now appear on that list at ages that no longer seem so far removed. It's not just life’s seniors; classmates, juniors, and those who lived through similar times as I did are quietly joining the ranks of the departed. In my sixties, I didn't quite feel this way. The thought that I might soon be part of such a list... well, it's brought forth a new perspective, that's for sure.

But you know, when it comes to myself, it's a different story. I often find myself admiring those sprightly older folks I barely know, thinking, "Wow, they're amazing at that age." Hearing of their adventures or achievements, I'm genuinely impressed. Yet, sometimes I later find out those "elderly" folks are younger than me. It makes me wonder—am I the one who's still full of energy? Although, honestly, I don't feel particularly aware of that. Whether I'm contemplating my potential inclusion in the obituaries or diligently working away, forgetting all about it, both are equally parts of who I am.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. After all, I have the likes of Tadanori Yokoo and Kazumi Kurigami above me.
