You're the one who's got to do it!
Shigesato Itoi

When a brilliant idea strikes me, one that feels like it could break through any situation, I say it out loud to the people around me. And when that idea is fresh and vibrant, spreading out like ripples, it makes me genuinely happy. In moments of such excitement, crew member A or stakeholder B might respond with, "That's it! We've got it!" gladly receiving and celebrating the idea. It's then that I, a bit exhilarated, declare in a mock-angry tone, "You're the one who needs to think it through!" or "You're the one who's got to do it!" I mean, yes, there's a touch of real frustration in there. But truthfully, it's said with trust, expectation, and encouragement for the young folks around me. So in reality, the exclamation marks should probably have a little "(laugh)" attached to them.

But, honestly, I'm serious about it. You can't just sit around waiting, thinking, "Itoi will come up with something eventually." You're the main player here. You're not on the side that gives praise; you're on the side that earns it. Keep impressing me, keep pushing forward. I genuinely mean that.

This "You're the one who's got to do it!" is connected to the idea of "giving dreams legs," and it's a crucial concept. It's something I'd like to print on a T-shirt in concise English. "You Do!" sounds a bit like a reprimand, doesn't it? "Your Turn!" might be close. So I tried asking ChatGPT for suggestions: "You're the one who should do it!" "You should be the one creating!" "Stop just admiringâ€”make something yourself." Hmm, they seem a bit cumbersome.

After some back-and-forth, we settled on "You do it!" or maybe "Your turn!" I think a T-shirt saying "I do it!" could work too. But really, it's about "You do it!"

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. A shirt with "You do it!" on the back and "I do it!" on the front sounds just about right.
