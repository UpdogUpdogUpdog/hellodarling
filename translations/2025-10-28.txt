Approaching the age of seventy-seven.
Shigesato Itoi

・It’s not out of pessimism, nor is it a point of pride, but I find myself now a trio: "me + the hospital + the gym." While I don't have any particularly serious illnesses, I do go for regular check-ups and take medication consistently. To slow down the decline of my body, I engage in a level of training that I can attend without reluctance. My familiar doctor and the trainer who’s become like a friend are almost part of who I am. If I were to quit either the hospital or the gym, I think I’d be living as a frailer old man. We aren’t a duo in a three-legged race, but rather a trio in a six-legged team. At least, that’s what I often say to people around me. But I’ve been making a big mistake.

In a two-person three-legged race, you tie one leg of each person together. If you apply this to three people, you’d tie one leg of each person on the sides to the one in the middle, making it not a six-legged, but a four-legged race.

All this to say, reaching this age has made me truly understand that my well-being isn’t just my own doing.

And it’s not just about physical health. If I hadn't started the "Almost Daily Itoi Newspaper" back in 1998, just before I turned fifty, venturing into the unknown, I wouldn't have met the crew at "Hobonichi." I’d probably be doing only what I could handle, complaining about what's fun, what's a hassle, or what’s boring, giving my all just within my personal limits. In reality, what we’re doing at "Hobonichi" now is a collection of things I can’t do alone. I contribute what I do best, better than others, but beyond that, it’s all things I couldn’t manage on my own, and because of that, the "Hobonichi" team can create something interesting. After all, even Shohei Ohtani can’t play baseball alone.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. I want to tell people in their fifties, "The fun starts here."
