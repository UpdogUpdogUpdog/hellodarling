A Wasteful Way of Working  
by Shigesato Itoi

I've spent a long time working freelance, and since then, I've been running "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shimbun" (Hobonichi), so I'm not too familiar with the typical corporate work style. During my freelance days, I collaborated with other companies and only caught a glimpse of how everyone was working. Also, having only observed a few client companies and advertising agencies during a certain period, I can't pretend to be an expert on the matter.

Everyone seemed to work diligently, and as an outsider, I was involved in their processes. But there was always something on my mind: the sheer volume of "necessary but unused work" seemed overwhelming.

This work was primarily done to "pass through" various levels. It was about getting approval from superiors, superiors of superiors, clients, and clients' superiors. To achieve this, the focus was on making the desired Plan A look appealing through Plans B, C, and D, along with materials explaining why these plans deserved approval, market research results, and so on. Everyone was busily engaged in creating these "presentations." Often, the truly essential part could be brutally simplified to a single sketch and a line of text. Even if a proposal was 20 pages long, 19 pages were usually just proof that "we've thought this through" (and probably still are).

While everyone was busy working to "pass through," the initiative lay with the other party, and they couldn't make independent judgments about what was good. As a result, the work became endless. There are voices saying that Japan's productivity is declining, but people are diligently workingâ€”just to "pass through." It seemed wasteful to me, this squandering of work effort.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shimbun" today. At "Hobonichi," there are hardly any "presentations."
