Thoughts on Eel  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Even when I had a fever, I could always eat eel.  
There was a time when I genuinely believed that.  
I always have an answer ready for when people ask about my favorite food.  
At some point, I decided to respond with "croquettes."  
By settling on "croquettes" for the time being,  
I can speak about various reasons and memories associated with them.  
There was a time when I thought "fugu" might be the answer,  
but since not everyone has tried it, especially younger people,  
and I didn't want to come off as boasting about something fancy,  
I chose not to mention it, though I do like it.  
Whether it's "tonkatsu," "curry," or "delicious sushi," any answer is correct,  
but now that I think about it, I never considered "eel."  
I do love it, enough that I could eat it even with a fever.  
However, at some point, while I still love it dearly,  
it became something I eat "without any particular enthusiasm."  
These days, if I had a fever, I wouldn't eat eel.

If a place is said to have delicious eel, I'm inclined to go.  
Whether it's a small shop near the Tone River that serves wild eel,  
or a long-established, famous restaurant with a history, they're all great.  
But any place that hangs a sign as an eel restaurant  
is generally good—delicious in a typical way.  
And nowadays, the prices reflect that quality too.

Some people prefer eel rice bowls to eel boxes, and I get that.  
There's a certain joy in eating rice with that special sauce,  
and you appreciate it more when there's less eel.  
Also, no other fish dish treats the skin with as much care as eel does.  
The deliciousness of eel lies in the oil between the skin and the flesh, and the slightly charred skin itself.  
While all good grilled fish share this trait to some extent,  
eel, without a doubt, values the skin the most.  
I don't know exactly when the "Day of the Ox" in midsummer is, but surely,  
I must have made a reservation to eat eel in August.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
I wonder what overseas travelers think of eel.
