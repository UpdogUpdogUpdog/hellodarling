Young People's Stories Are Long  
By Shigesato Itoi

・When I make a statement like that, I know I'll get responses like, "That's not true." So sometimes I think about rephrasing it more objectively, like, "Is it just my age that makes young people's stories feel long?" But honestly, that feels like too much trouble, so I just leave it as is.

Maybe it’s just the people around me, but I've been telling young folks for ages—assistants from way back, newcomers, all sorts of young people—that their stories are too long. I’m sure there are plenty of times when I’m the one droning on, but let’s just put that aside for now.

Over time, after being told "Your story is too long" a few times, these young folks start to change. Their stories gradually get shorter. Maybe they've learned to keep it brief, or perhaps they’ve just figured out how to not make it feel long.

Whether it's a boss or anyone else, people generally want to "receive" what the other person is saying. It’s like they’re reaching out, ready to grab what’s being handed over, but when it takes forever to receive it, that’s what a long story feels like. Yet, the one telling the story just wants to share all this information, piling it on because they feel it’s not enough otherwise. But for the listener, who doesn’t need that much, it’s more like, "Just hand it over already." In the midst of adding and embellishing, the point gets lost, and that's when you hear, "Your story is too long." You see, communication is supposed to be an exchange, but when you’re young, you tend to prioritize "what to say" over the exchange itself.

Saying less won’t disadvantage you. Just because you say a lot doesn’t mean everything gets across. Probably, even a marriage proposal won’t go well if it’s too long, right?
