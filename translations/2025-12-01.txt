Here it is.

I knew it was coming.

I kept thinking, "It's coming, it's coming," and even though there's that saying, "Not yet means soon," I was telling myself since November that if I let my guard down, it would be here in no time. Whenever I felt overwhelmed with everything piling up, I'd casually say, "Let's push that to next month." But all those things I postponed had piled up. And before I knew it, there were more and more pressing matters, like "What should we do about that?" And just like that, here it is:

December!

At this point, I can't squeeze in any more plans; it's December, after all. Reservations, schedules, that person or this thing—it's all just impossible now. And me? I'm feeling pretty maxed out too. Back in the day, we used to have more time to ease into it, with faint jingles of bells here and there, a few Christmas trees popping up, all signaling the upcoming season in November. Heck, you'd even hear music from folks like Tatsuro Yamashita or Yumi Matsutoya. But nowadays, there's no gradient. It's just suddenly, "Here you go! It's December," like a surprise card handed to you.

December! And then Christmas! Year-end, New Year! From here on, we're just being chased down, aren't we? I miss the days when we could leisurely schedule a dentist appointment saying, "Let's do it in December," even though it feels like just the other day. Around me, people seem to have birthdays crammed into October, November, and December. And why is it that musicians often have concerts in November and December? They perform all through December, saying they'll take a break next year. And then there are those who start the New Year with a show at the Budokan. It's like choking on mochi during the New Year holidays. Not that I'm complaining. I'm just thrown off by December's sneak attack.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. Next year, let's have longer springs and autumns, please. A little more calm.
