Continuing from yesterday. LIFING: Life in Motion!
Shigesato Itoi

・Yesterday, I spent the whole day pondering what I wrote here. It all started with a line from Utamaro to Tsutaju in a historical drama. "Painting, you see, is like capturing the essence of life," he said while showing the original picture from "Selection of Insect Paintings." So, paintings capture "life," do they? If that's the case, what about music, dance... As I kept thinking, I realized that everything in this world is engaged in some form of "life." Truly, all living things partake in the activity of life. That's what I wrote about yesterday.

As I delved deeper, it struck me: "life" is indeed "LIFE"! The book I titled was "The Book of LIFE." We are always conscious of "LIFE." It's true, isn't it? "Life" encompasses living, existence, and everyday life. The beating heart is a symbol of "LIFE," and the everyday endeavors of ordinary people in the streets are "LIFE" too. In verb form, it becomes "LIVE." It seems everything is an expression of "life."

Yesterday, I nourished my "life" with breakfast, eagerly checked the release of the "Hobonichi Techo," created through the collective effort of many "lives," hit the gym to train and invigorate my "life," and exchanged words in a meeting to articulate "life." On stage, a band showered me with the essence of their "life," and here I am now, piecing together my own "life" bit by bit. I've been actively engaged in the present progression of "life." If that's the case, the progressive form of "LIFE" should be "LIVING," but no, a new term—"LIFE・ing" or "LIFING"—sounds better. "LIFING: Life in Motion!" Yes, this feels right. Isn't this the way people want to live, with this kind of awareness? Maybe I should create a poster or something.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. Not just "Hobonichi," everything is "LIFING."
