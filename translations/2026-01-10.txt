The Order of Learning Things  
Shigesato Itoi

・A first-grader, eager to "be able" at everything, once boasted, "I can do division." It reminded me of her mother, who as a child would declare, "I can speak English," mimicking Tamori-san's comedic "English." But how did this fascination with division even start? As adults, we humor her with simple numbers, asking, "What's 9 divided by 3?" or "What's 12 divided by 4?" She gives answers that aren't just random guesses. We played this game for a bit, then I asked, "Can you do multiplication?" and she candidly replied, "No, I can't." I found this amusing. The reason she can "do division" is likely because she can picture the number being divided. She can visualize 9 or 12, maybe using her fingers, and from there, figure out how many times 3 or 4 fits into it. When I learned, it was multiplication tables first, then division, so I couldn't imagine it any other way. With larger numbers, she might struggle, but indeed, it's possible to grasp division without knowing multiplication.

There's this notion that learning must follow a certain order—something I've been told countless times, and it's somewhat ingrained in me. But it's better to think, "That's not always the case." A child with poor music grades could become a rock star, and by the way, that child "couldn't do multiplication tables." I remember reading books about dinosaurs and inventions labeled "for fifth or sixth graders." It didn't matter if I couldn't read or understand everything. We learn by mixing in what we don't know. Eventually, we'll discover the "best way" somewhere along the line. An adult's role might be to convey that "either way is okay" when asked.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan." There are many paths up the mountain. Enjoying the climb is the best part, isn't it?
