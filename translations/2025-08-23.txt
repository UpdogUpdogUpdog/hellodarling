Confessions of a Spendthrift  
by Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»Every so often, it's like I'm possessed by the urge to splurge. I never set out with the intention of wasting money, but looking back, that's exactly what it turns out to be.

Once I started working, I bought a few guitars. First, a Fender Telecaster, then a Stratocaster, and eventually a Gibson Les Paul. These were all luxury items, indulgences I had no right to buy. I wasn't even much of a player, but I felt like I had to own them. The first Telecaster, I bought from Kawai Musical Instruments in Japan. The others, I picked up during a trip to the U.S. for a shoot. I played the first Telecaster a bit during a brief stint in a band, but after that, they mostly sat untouched. Looking back now, it feels almost disgraceful. I ended up giving the Gibson to a young guitarist at the time, and later, he sent me cash as his way of paying for it. It turned out to be a good decision, I think. The other two guitars, I also passed on to people who were serious about music. The conscientious recipient still insists he's just "holding onto them" for me, but honestly, I'd rather they be put to good use than returned.

It was much later in life that I bought a Rickenbacker. Those of a certain age will know it as the guitar played by John Lennon of The Beatles. While it's changed from its original form, its appearance remains nearly identical. This was a quintessential "grown-up purchase." Owning the same guitar John Lennon once held is like possessing a piece of him. I know it's a ridiculous notion. No one even knows I own this guitar, so it's not likely to end up in anyone else's hands for now. Perhaps I should mention it in my will someday. Naturally, it remains sleeping in its case as we speak. From various perspectives, this would be seen as wasteful, and I can't deny that I feel the same. I'm foolish, but perhaps that's just fine.
