Hobo Station AKAGI. First and foremost, thank you.

Shigesato Itoi

・has finally entered its alpha phase. The alpha opening is, so to speak, a trial run. While we may cause some inconveniences, we are grateful to have begun. We introduced the place to the locals of Akagi, those we’ve worked with in Maebashi, members of the media, and all the friends who helped create this space. From the afternoon, albeit briefly, we declared the station "open." After all, even though Akagi is relatively close, it's still nestled in the mountains. We hesitated to invite our associates from Tokyo and took a cautious approach. The scenery is breathtaking, but "Hobo Station" is quite expansive, so we braced ourselves for the possibility of no visitors. Still, just in case we were lucky enough to be packed, several crew members from "Hobonichi" came to lend a hand. As we welcomed the memorable "1101 Day," even before we officially opened, the roads began to clog with traffic, the parking lot filled up quickly, and a long line of visitors formed in front of "Hobo Station." Despite being a trial run, the inconveniences and challenges popped up one after another, and although our staff has plenty of event experience, this was a first-time scenario. We found ourselves scrambling with hardly any time to spare. Yesterday, there were almost no updates on related social media because everyone was so busy with tasks that there was no time to spare. Even I, who should have had the most free time, was too busy to even glance at my phone.

The "trial run" presented us with a mountain of challenges right from the start. Some crew members who were supposed to return to Tokyo stayed on to tackle the second day of the "trial." While I returned to Tokyo, I left half my heart in Akagi. Every time we host an event, I'm reminded of this: our guests are truly warm-hearted. It might seem like we're leaning on their generosity, but we are sincerely grateful. I apologize and thank you deeply for bearing with the chaos of our alpha opening day.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today as well. In the middle of the holiday, with the autumn leaves of Akagi in full display, "Hobo Station" enters its second day of trials.
