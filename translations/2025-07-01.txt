A little talk about flowers.  
Shigesato Itoi

・Every flower is a flower, each blooming in its own way.  
  Just think of how many songs have been sung about flowers.

  Before a flower blooms, we look forward to the day it will.  
  And when it does, we can rejoice in its blossoming.

  Once a flower blooms, we begin to anticipate the fruit it will bear,  
  eagerly looking forward to the future.

  Not to be like the flower, but like the root, some might say.  
  But a flower is just fine as it is.

  Flowers bloom to attract insects, it seems,  
  yet they end up enticing people as well.

  Often used as a metaphor, surpassing any flower,  
  but the flower itself doesn't mind such things being said.

  A flower's life may be brief.  
  Yet, it blooms again and again.

  Sometimes, flowers bloom beautifully thanks to people's care,  
  but even without people, they still bloom beautifully.

  Many people have "flower" in their names,  
  though it seems less common for boys.

  When people say "dumplings over flowers," it's not just about the dumplings—  
  it's because flowers are so well-loved.

  Even without a story, if you listen to these two-line musings  
  like a lullaby, it might be interesting in its own way.  
  Essays on flowers, novels about flowers, poems about flowers are all wonderful,  
  but perhaps a simple "fragment" about flowers is nice too.  
  "Feel," "think," "ponder," "play"—  
  you can experience so much of that, I'm sure.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today.  
A lullaby like this might be nice. A picture book could be lovely too.
