S. Itoi's "The Shohei Ohtani Method"  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Today, I'm setting out to share something incredibly useful.  
   It's practical wisdom you can apply immediately,  
   a textbook of courage and action, and a practice of achieving the seemingly impossible.  
   It's something anyone can understand and everyone can emulate.  
   No charge—just the satisfaction of being of service to you all.

   Whether you know it or not, I regularly go to the gym to keep my body in shape.  
   Left to my own devices, I quickly hit a wall and lose interest,  
   so I've enlisted a trainer who's both exceptional in skill and character.  
   It's not that I want to become some muscle-bound show-off,  
   so I enjoy a mix of stretching and training.  
   But it's not all easygoing; there are challenging moments, too.  
   Doing twenty sit-ups isn't too tough,  
   but when it comes to doing another set of twenty, that gets a bit rough.  
   Still, I push myself to the edge of what I can do.  
   Of course, I dislike the discomfort—it's not something I enjoy.  
   Yet, I do it anyway, even though it's all for my own sake.  
   Such a begrudging mindset can ironically make it all the more difficult.

   Yesterday, I had a revelation.  
   "Shohei Ohtani trains so intensely, yet he never seems to resent it, does he?  
   With all that training, it must be extremely tough."  
   "But he probably thinks, 'Doing this will make my ideal play come true.  
   Beyond this weight, this struggle, lies that home run.'"  
   That's it—think like Shohei Ohtani!  
   No, during training, just become Ohtani!  
   That's the realization I had.  
   Whether pushing, pulling, or lifting weights,  
   I decided to do it all by embodying Shohei Ohtani.  
   In the mirror of my mind, I see Ohtani's face.  
   When I think of my arms, torso, and legs as Ohtani's, the struggle feels different.  
   The usual 13 or 20 reps start to feel insufficient.  
   This is a must-try—turning all of Japan into Shohei Ohtani.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
Ohtani doesn't walk to you, so you must walk to him. You are Ohtani.
