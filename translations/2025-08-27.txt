Ordinarily Delicious  
by Shigesato Itoi

・There's a particular way of praising food as "ordinarily delicious" that you often hear among younger folks. In this expression, the focus is on the "delicious." It's a positive acknowledgment, first and foremost. Yet, what about the "ordinarily" that precedes it? It's not like saying "extremely delicious," but rather implies that the food is better than expected. 

That's why, as a matter of etiquette, you probably wouldn't use "ordinarily delicious" when a senior treats you to an expensive steak. In such situations, there's already a high level of expectation, and if the food surpasses that, "ordinarily" just doesn't cut it. In those cases, you wouldn't go for a casual "extremely," but something more like "What is this?!" or "The best I've ever had," or even "I could die happy today!"—expressions that capture extraordinary value beyond the everyday.

"Ordinarily delicious" affirms the food's goodness but places it within the context of one's everyday value system. It's something you might say about a dessert from a convenience store, a reasonably priced ethnic dish, or a slightly unusual souvenir snack.

For older generations, "ordinarily" might come off as a bit condescending, but it's important to understand that's not the intention. It's not "delicious if you think about it," but rather "delicious as recognized within my world," akin to casting a vote of approval. However, let's be honest—this "ordinarily" phrasing is a trend, and I predict it'll fall out of use eventually.

What catches my attention more, though, is the frequent use of "extremely," which lies on the opposite end of "ordinarily." It's a case of value inflation, yet people of all ages use it liberally. I think it's a simplified form of "ridiculously," and honestly, everyone from young to old seems to be overusing "extremely."
