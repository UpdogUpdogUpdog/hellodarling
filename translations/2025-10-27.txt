Help seems to fit better than service.

Shigesato Itoi

I suppose I rarely use the word "service." Sure, there’s a whole "service industry," and I might have used the term a little, but I’ve never really liked it. Perhaps it's because it carries connotations of "servitude" or "labor exchanged for money." Phrases like "family service" or "unpaid overtime service" have always left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.

Thinking about it, "Hobo Nikkan" doesn’t really operate on the concept of "service" either. It feels more like "helping," "supporting," "assisting," or "aiding." I learned that "irasshaimase" in English translates to "May I help you?" and indeed, that's what I would hear in American stores. The "help" here—"Is there anything I can assist you with?"—seems to resonate with how we work. While rescuing lives is certainly about "helping," it leans more toward the lighter sense of "assisting." The kanji composition even suggests adding a little "strength" to the inherent power of "旦" to create "助."

We often ask our users, customers, or readers, "May I help you?" Are you interested? How about this event? Looking for something enjoyable? Try this story. Searching for a product like this? This is the kind of communication we engage in. Among our crew, too, we offer help if someone’s struggling, believing that together we can lift anything. I think we’re all working to support each other in growing and achieving more.

Exactly, it’s not about "service." It’s about a flat, mutual exchange of helping and being helped. So, may I help you with your day?
