The Many Facets of Being "Relied Upon"
By Shigesato Itoi

・I think I'll just ramble on with whatever comes to mind.
There's a phrase, "having something to strive for."
Isn't this what everyone is really after?
It's a bit like "finding fulfillment" or "feeling motivated."
Living each day with a sense of purpose is the best, isn't it?
I'm sure there are countless scenarios for it,
but let's say, for instance, "the corn you've planted is growing,
and just thinking it's almost ready to eat
makes watering it feel worthwhile." That's nice, isn't it?
Or when someone suddenly says "thank you as always"
for something you never thought anyone noticed—those moments are good, too.
Maybe most of us work simply because we want to experience this sense of purpose.

Then there's being "relied upon" or "counted on."
People sometimes say it like it's a burden,
but I think it's actually a wonderful and happy thing.
Even if we say "It's such a hassle" or "Can't you ask someone else?"
deep down, it doesn't feel bad at all.
I don't really know what it means to live leisurely,
but for those who've completely quit working,
it must feel lonely not to be relied upon.
Whether it's being asked to help out with something,
or just being included in a headcount,
it's about being seen as someone who's better off being there, right?

People work not just to earn money.
We lend a hand or offer our strength for those we know.
It's partly because "that's what we want to do."
It's not just about jobs or tasks;
sometimes just "being there" is what people count on.
Family relationships might be like that.
Pets, like dogs and cats, are "relied upon" just for "being there," too.
"I want to be with you" sounds like a line from a love letter,
but when you think about it, it's similar to the bond with pets.
It's this kind of "being relied upon"
that resembles "expecting nothing from each other."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.
I just want to keep chatting about these kinds of vague things.
