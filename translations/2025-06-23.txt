My Favorite Book Title  
Shigesato Itoi

・In the middle of the night, I find myself staring absently at my bookshelf. Even without reading a single page, I feel a sense of having finished a book. There's one book that stands tall like the Eiffel Tower among the others, shaping the entire landscape of my collection.

Its subtitle is "When a Sutra Becomes a Scripture," but all I can see from the shelf is the spine. Even so, I get the gist of what it's about, and it makes me want to imagine its contents. Yet, I've never actually read this book. I just keep gazing at the spine, thinking how wonderful it is. These Buddhist scriptures, the so-called "sutras," aren't they something? Those ancient envoys to Tang China went through great trouble to bring these precious texts back. They're written in Chinese characters, so we tend to think of them as Chinese. But if you think about it, Buddhism started with the Buddha in India. Back in those days, monks like Xuanzang* ventured to India (known as Tenjiku) in search of these sacred texts. They must have originally been written in the languages of India. Then, they were translated into Chinese characters. I never thought about it that way—ignorant as I am. From India, they crossed the sea to Japan. It makes me ponder religion, language, writing, culture, distances, and what it means to live. Even without reading it, these are the thoughts this book's title and content inspire in me. Perhaps one day I'll start reading it, but I have no idea when that day will come. Just seeing the spine that reads, "How Buddhist Scriptures Were Translated into Chinese," makes me feel like this book is already fulfilling an incredible role. Despite looking at it so often, why haven't I read it? That's another curiosity of mine. Hmm, I tried explaining it to myself. Imagine if there's a loquat tree somewhere in the garden. Whether you eat its fruit or not, you always remember that the loquat tree is there, right? Maybe it's something like that.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. This season, a variety of delicious fruits are starting to appear, aren't they?
