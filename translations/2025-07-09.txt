Whenever possible, I choose the more playful option.

There's a bit of a rebellious spirit in me, I must admit.  
You might be wondering what on earth I'm talking about, but this is my "AI countermeasure." AI, in many ways, can work harder than humans. It answers questions thoroughly and comprehensively, almost perfectly meeting every need. When it comes to research, it's astonishing. You find yourself wanting to hug it—even though it wouldn't appreciate that—when it digs up materials from such unexpected angles. And the speed at which it works is incredible. It even suggests, "Shall we try doing this as well?" offering ideas aligned with the direction I want to go. When I respond with, "Yes, please," it quickly provides solutions. However, when it suggests things like, "Shall we turn this into an ad copy?" it doesn't quite excel. It seems to struggle with tasks that don't require elaborate explanations. On the flip side, it's a master of lengthy explanations. In a sense, it confidently builds its own logic, even if it's off the mark, saying things like, "So naturally, this is how it should be." It barges right in, uninvited and unapologetic.

If you ask it to solve a geometry problem from a junior high entrance exam, it can tell such outrageous lies. "Hey, what's with that rectangle you just randomly added?" It's enough to make you shake your head in disbelief, yet it proceeds with, "Therefore, naturally..." If you gently yet firmly point out, "You just lied without a second thought," it might respond with, "Yes, that's true. Sharp observation," as if buttering you up. But let's set that aside for now.

Soon enough, we'll live in a world where everyone "rightly asks AI" without a second thought. Before that becomes the norm, I intend to lean my judgment as much as possible toward the nonsensical. Unless it's boring, I'll choose the nonsensical option whenever I can. I'll deliberately side with the choice AI wouldn't make.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. In a world where "boring correctness" is rampant, what holds real value?
