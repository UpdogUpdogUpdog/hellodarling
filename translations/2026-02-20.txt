Passing by the Realm of "Pure Language"  
Shigesato Itoi

Yesterday, quite unusually, I ended my writing in a way that practically shouted, "I'll write more on this tomorrow."  
(First, here's a quick recap of what I wrote yesterday.)  
There was a time when writing in "classical language" felt restrictive for expressing various things. This led to the emergence of the "genbun itchi" style, which integrated spoken language into writing, bringing expression closer to reality. Then, during the era when "genbun itchi" became the norm, some copywriters jokingly started talking about "genbun issho." My guess is that this style originated from TV commercial scripts. It's very close to "everyday language," making it approachable and easy to read for anyone. It conveys thoughts effectively and is easily understood.

Yet, all this talk is about different styles of writing. For those who aren't particularly interested in writing or reading, none of these styles will appeal. There are many people who just can't find a connection with the idea of representing the world through the tool of "words." And, no matter how far we go, what can be expressed through words is only a tiny fragment of the world. (Now, a sudden shift in perspective.) However, even those who aren't interested in reading books or essays will read manga and watch anime, diving deep into those expressions. Manga, with its sequential art, includes text. Some have rather lengthy passages and convey complex ideas. It's curious—"they'll read that, won't they?"

While we're busy pondering how language evolves—from classical forms to "genbun itchi" and the interplay of written and spoken words—manga seems to bypass us effortlessly. Could it be that the things expressed in academic papers, poetry, and even "silence" itself, can also find expression in manga? While it might be challenging for an individual to achieve this alone, like with filmmaking, a team could collaborate (though it's not about setting them against written text). The possibilities for manga as an extraordinary form of expression still seem boundless. I want to explore ways of thinking that don't rely solely on "pure language."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. Here I am, once more, writing about these musings in "words."
