As a Spectator of the Ramen Battles  
Shigesato Itoi

・I like to think I have a greater-than-average love for ramen. If I hear about a place with particularly delicious ramen, I’ll hop on a train, join the line, and savor a bowl. I have my regular spots, too, and enjoy keeping up with ramen-related news. Yet, I don't think I quite qualify as a ramen fanatic. I visit, I eat, I savor, and I reflect, but I maintain a slight distance from it all.

Ramen has an intriguing competitive edge to it. Each bowl seems to embody a grand life-or-death kind of contest, much like the comedy scene today. In comedy, with nothing but the raw power of "talk," one can seemingly soar to great success, and we feel the thrill of that competition. Despite its leisurely goal of making people laugh, comedy has become something else. Ramen, too, is just a humble soup dish, yet contenders continually emerge, declaring, "I'm the best!" With whispers of "this place is amazing," or "that shop is unbeatable," they gather followers in droves. The ramen chefs come across as athletes or warriors in this fierce arena.

The "secret techniques" and "research" behind ramen-making are almost like the esoteric rituals of medieval alchemists. The proportions, timing, and methods are so complex that they defy understanding. However, we patrons, myself included, gratefully partake, exclaiming, "Delicious, as expected!" To be honest, I’m not entirely convinced these meticulously crafted techniques are all that extraordinary. It's like we're slurping up the mysterious modern-day "ancient manuscripts" of ramen from our bowls. Yet, that’s what makes it so fascinating. The battles among these culinary athletes are captivating, and I have deep respect for their innovation and research. Still, a part of me wonders, "Isn't there a simpler, yet still delicious way to make ramen?"
