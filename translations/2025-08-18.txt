The Rise and Fall of "Kakkoii"
Shigesato Itoi

・Though I don't use it as often these days, I still find myself using the word "kakkoii" to offer praise. It likely originates from "格好良い," but it carries a slightly different nuance.

I wish I could speak with the authority of a historian about when "kakkoii" first appeared in the world. Until I was about eighteen, the word was absent from my surroundings. At the very least, I never used it, nor did my friends. We lived our lives without "kakkoii." The first time I heard it was when a classmate, K, had his nephew—a grade-school boy—exclaim, "Kuu-chan, kakkoii!" after K did something. I was right there, witnessing it. In my ears, "Kuu-chan, kakkoii!" sounded like the highest form of praise. The word "kakkoii" itself was kakkoii.

Gradually, I started integrating it into my life. Before I knew it, living without "kakkoii" became impossible. Even now, a significant part of my value system is shaped by the feeling of "kakkoii." Our older brothers often used the expression "ikasu," with Yujiro Ishihara as its icon, but in our generation, "kakkoii" steadily gained ground.

However, I feel that the value of "kakkoii" is slowly declining. Perhaps "iketeru" and "emoi" are the new forces taking over. For women, maybe it's "kawaii" or "oshare." Even if the frequency of "kakkoii" decreases, I suspect I'll keep on using it.

By the way, isn't the recent overuse of "meccha" a bit too much to handle...?

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. The "history of praise expressions" could make for a compelling thesis topic, don't you think?
