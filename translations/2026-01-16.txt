Why Don't Birds Fall from the Wires? A Reconsideration  
Shigesato Itoi  

・For over 27 years, I've been writing something here every day, so I've probably repeated myself a few times. "Why don’t birds perched on power lines fall?" I've likely addressed this question two or three times before. It was a topic I found intriguing when I read about it in a book during my younger days. Of course, one could answer by explaining the structure of a bird's feet, but at the time, the answer given was, "Because they can fly even if they fall." While I was genuinely impressed by this answer, I’ve always felt an urge to ponder it further, and it often comes back to me. I still haven't fully grasped the question and answer.

After pondering for a long time, I've come up with my own "theory." I watched a video of children hanging off the monkey bars in a park, chatting happily. They swung their bodies like they were on a swing. A cautious adult might gently warn them, "Don't fool around; it's dangerous," and indeed, there are times when they fall, so it’s not without risk. Whether it’s monkey bars, swings, or climbing trees, falling could be dangerous. That much is true, but the kids playing don’t think that way. I recall doing plenty of potentially risky play myself. It's not because they have "courage." They're simply "hanging and playing." It's not even about having so much "confidence" that they don't need "courage." They aren’t doing it with thoughts of "courage" or "confidence" in mind. And further still, they’re not even thinking about "falling or not falling"!

With the birds on the power lines, too, the question "Why don’t they fall?" is a human curiosity—the birds aren’t pondering it. It’s not because they have confidence from being able to fly, either. In essence, whether it's human children or birds, when it’s time to fall, they fall! You could call it luck, or maybe it’s an accident. Statistically, most don’t fall, but sometimes they do. "Just doing what they can do" becomes a question for those who can’t.
