The Reversed Mirror  
Shigesato Itoi

・Meeting oneself is truly a challenge.  
  People look at me and think that's who I am.  
  But I can't see the version of me that they see.  
  This is the same for everyone—  
  the self I know is probably different  
  from the self everyone else knows.

  Sure, there's me in photos and videos.  
  If someone points that out, well, they're right.  
  There's the version of me captured through a camera lens.  
  I might think, "Oh, so that's me, huh?"  
  But somehow, I don't feel like looking too closely.  
  Do I want to see it, or do I not want to?  
  The monitor screen of a smartphone "selfie" shows me,  
  but it's still like looking in a mirror—  
  left and right are flipped.

  Why am I writing about something that seems so middle school?  
  It's because I bought a peculiar mirror online, and it arrived at my house.  
  It's called a "reversed mirror."  
  I have no idea what its intended use is,  
  but it's described as a "mirror where you can see yourself as others do."  
  It wasn't particularly expensive, and I was curious, so I bought it.  
  A whole new world appeared before me.  
  There was a version of me slightly different  
  from the one I always see in the mirror.  
  The T-shirt print not being reversed felt strange and refreshing,  
  but more than that, this "me" felt different.  
  Is this the "me" everyone meets...?  
  The mirror doesn't really offer any practical benefits,  
  but I feel like I experienced something for the first time.

  Of course, my household supervisor will likely want to tidy it away soon,  
  and it'll vanish somewhere in the storage room before I know it.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
But creating another version of yourself is quite effective.
