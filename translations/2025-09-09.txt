I had given up on the thought of saury.

・It seems this year has brought a bountiful catch of saury. In recent years, the number of saury caught has been dwindling, and the fish themselves have been getting smaller. Many people, myself included, have vaguely thought that saury might become a rare fish and eventually even go extinct. There were various reasons cited for the poor catches, with rising sea temperatures being the main one, along with increased international competition and a decline in the fish population itself. Either way, the situation was often linked to global warming. This summer was particularly brutal with the heat, so naturally, I had no expectations for the saury catch.

Yet here we are, with saury that are large and plump. Against all odds, a lot of saury have been caught. It's a pleasant surprise, and of course, I joined in the feast. In recent years, the peak catch was in 2008 at 340,000 tons, while around 2021 and 2022, it was below 20,000 tons. So, even if this year is considered a good catch, it would never match the peak years, but it defies the expectations of a continual decline.

Including myself, we all have a "habit of thinking" that leads us to imagine the "easy-to-think" scenarios. We predict the future as if there are no "anomalies" or "variations." This is a common tendency, and it can't be helped, but in reality, anomalies always find their way in. Statistically, this year was another poor one for saury compared to average years, but there was indeed an "anomaly" of "perhaps a bit of a good catch." Once we recognize it, we might be able to explain it. Everything seems to be a cycle of such incidents. Once-in-a-century weather extremes, volcanic eruptions, massive typhoons, earthquakes, unexpected economic downturns, or wars—these are all interwoven into what we consider "average years." The "flat, average predictions" are common, but they're weak.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" again today. We think about the things we can think about and laugh while considering the things we can't.
