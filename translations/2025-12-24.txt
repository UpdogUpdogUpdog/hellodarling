Thoughts on Christmas Eve  
by Shigesato Itoi

・I dropped out of school, had no job, and decided to enroll in a copywriting school because it seemed promising, but I had no real prospects. It was cold outside, and the festive December bustle at the time felt incredibly lonely to twenty-year-old me.

The city was filled with Christmas songs playing non-stop from God-knows-where. Chic clothing stores and pastry shops set up outdoor stalls, with people in red outfits loudly calling out to passersby. But looking back, maybe that picture-perfect, bustling December wasn't as widespread as I remember. Just like in those old documentary films, the camera focuses on what it wants to highlight (I wonder what the temples and traditional sweet shops were doing). At twenty, I weighed only 53 kilograms and was always cold, viewing the world through a rough lens. I thought everyone else was happy, especially those with cherished families or partners. They cut cake together, waited for Santa, walked hand in hand with scarves wrapped snugly. I felt different—not angry, but a bit envious and definitely lonely.

Compared to those days, December has quietly transformed without me even noticing. The jingle of bells isn't as constant, Tatsuro Yamashita’s songs don't echo as much, and glittery gold and silver stars aren't as prominent. It's not just because of a weaker economy. Perhaps everyone realized it's okay not to go all out. Now, each person spends Christmas Eve in their own blend of joy and solitude.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. Somewhere, that twenty-year-old version of me is still wandering the December streets.
