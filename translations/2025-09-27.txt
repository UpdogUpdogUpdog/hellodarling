The Verdict: Are We Japan's Top Squatting Company?
by Shigesato Itoi

・Wow, what a performance that was. We made it to the quarterfinals, only to face the team that would go on to win the championship, and, unfortunately, we were narrowly defeated. Although we didn't get a medal, I personally consider that match our "Best Bout." Losing by a hair and winning by a whisker—they're quite similar, aren't they? But, even if it's just a tiny difference, the team that claimed victory twice in a row was truly formidable. Our "Hobo Nikkan" team was a picture of cheerful frustration, but I happened to catch sight of Makki, who was supposed to be our reporter, sobbing openly. Even our new member, Mr. T-Kuwa (who looks quite intimidating), was crying like a man, and the others couldn't calm down from the excitement.

I lingered there for a while before heading home, and let me tell you, if there's such a thing as contagious excitement, I caught it. Of course, I was cheering them on, and I was pretty pumped myself. But it's more than just that. Even after returning home, I couldn't settle down. I watched recorded TV shows and read the "exclusive text coverage" of the tournament, yet I couldn't bring myself to start working on this manuscript. There are plenty of other topics I could write about, themes to explore, but I just couldn't focus on any of them. Even now, I'm still in a state of disarray. So, I'm just writing my thoughts as they come.

What everyone seriously discussed was how we could add more "weight." Apparently, someone from another team has put on 12 kilos since last year. We were thinking, maybe each of us could gain two kilos by next year, all in muscle. I'm actually quite serious about this. I thought, why not take the opportunity to involve everyone, not just the "Hipparēzu" team? Maybe we could make bodyweight squats a routine for our entire crew. Imagine a company that's the top in Japan for squats, building strong thigh muscles. Wouldn't that be great? It'd improve our physique, too. I think I'll ask everyone at the office about it next week.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. The squat—it's the easiest way to build the largest muscles!
