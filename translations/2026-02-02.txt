Why is the Morning Paper Here?!

・I’ve only told a few close friends about this because it freaks me out, but it happened last year, I think. I was staying at a hotel and woke up late one morning. I went to the sink to brush my teeth, and there it was—a newspaper. 

Wait a second, did I put that there? I glanced at the front page and checked the date. It was today's news, with today’s date. But I just woke up, didn’t I? The newspaper should be outside my door, so how did it end up here? Did someone quietly slip into my room and place it in the bathroom? That would be a bizarre service for the hotel to offer, and anyway, I had the chain lock on, so no one could have come in. 

Did I somehow do this myself? I don’t know what time they deliver the morning paper to the hotel rooms, but the idea that I did it myself seems far more likely than someone else sneaking in. Could it be that I have no memory of doing it? Is this like that “sleepwalking” thing I’ve seen in old cartoons? Maybe there are pockets of “missing time” in my life that I just don’t remember. If I’ve been doing things without realizing it, that’s a pretty terrifying thought.

I’ve always been kind of fond of the idea of “general anesthesia.” You hear “Alright, you’re going to sleep now,” and then time halts at the “now,” only for you to come to with “Oh, you’re awake.” I find the gap between “now” and “Oh” fascinating—it’s like the world exists, but I’m not in it. But sleepwalking? That’s a whole different story. It’s unsettling and scary.

Well, after calming down and investigating a bit, I discovered it was likely due to the sleeping pills I’d been taking. Apparently, I’d grabbed the newspaper while still in that sleepy haze and just forgot about it. People often say they can’t remember things after drinking alcohol, but maybe it’s less scary when you know the cause.

Thanks for stopping by “Almost Daily” today. Since that incident, I haven’t had any more episodes of “missing time.”
