In the early 1980s, I found myself working on advertising for Seibu Department Stores. At that time, the company was under the leadership of Seiji Tsutsumi, who personally attended our presentations and sometimes even organized meetings for us. For a young, somewhat cocky copywriter like myself, the ideas Tsutsumi frequently shared were ahead of their time and incredibly fascinating. Moreover, since these ideas came straight from the top, they often saw the light of day. Witnessing these various visions come to life was a source of joy for a young upstart like me.

Back then, Tsutsumi was known for constantly reminding the executives and staff, almost to the point of exhaustion, that we were entering an "era of experiences over things." The company was then called "Seibu Distribution Group" and was part of the distribution industry. For the head of such a company to speak of "shifting from things to experiences" was, in essence, a redefinition of distribution itself. In the advertising department and the corporate planning office where I worked, this mantra was included in every proposal and report. "From things to experiences" became a sort of incantation within the company. Nearly half a century later, I suspect few of us fully grasped its meaning at the time, myself included. However, today, it's undeniable: we are indeed in an era that values experiences over things. Even at "Hobonichi," we view all work as content, considering "things as accumulations of experiences." It took me forty years to truly understand this concept.

If I could converse with Tsutsumi today, I'd want to discuss the necessity of "Ba" — the concept of place or space. While it's true we've shifted from things to experiences, isn't the notion of "Ba" also essential? As long as we humans are embodied and cannot escape that physicality, we need "Ba," both as an idea and a tangible reality, don't we? I wonder where such a casual conversation might lead.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. "Ba" is media, space, and capital, all rolled into one.
