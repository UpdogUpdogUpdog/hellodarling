What exactly is stamina? I sure wish I had more of it.

・My daughter’s daughter has just started first grade, and she seems to be having a blast every day. She gets ready in the morning, heads to school for five hours of classes, and I'm sure she plays during recess too. Then, she goes to this place called "gakudou," which she finds incredibly fun, and throws herself into it with great enthusiasm. If that wasn’t enough, she plays with friends she’s bonded with after coming home, spends time with family over meals or playing games, watches something on a screen, completes her homework, and takes a bath. Eventually, she conks out somewhere, falling asleep on the floor clutching onto something or other.

Now, being an “old man” myself, I couldn’t possibly keep up with the same routine. Yet, even such energetic kids supposedly lack the "stamina" that adults have. It seems children have the energy to dash around fueled by curiosity, but they don’t really have much endurance. Well, that makes sense. Sustaining effort over a long period seems beyond them. Adults, on the other hand, can stretch their energy over long periods and increase their strength through training.

Having observed “remarkable people” in various senses over the years, I’ve noticed they almost always have this "stamina." Whether it’s practicing, enduring, maintaining a positive outlook, or persisting, if their stamina runs out and they think, “Oh, I’m done,” they’ll either stop or regress. It’s not just about muscles or the body; it’s the same with thinking. Without the stamina to “keep going” or to “push just a little more,” you inevitably end up stopping. Having the capacity to push through when necessary is also a form of stamina. How does one acquire stamina, anyway? Come to think of it, children cultivate their stamina through their passionate play. Maybe adults and the elderly need to play more to build their stamina too. I wonder how Mick Jagger manages.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. Building stamina is a kind of "play," and with stamina, you can "play."
