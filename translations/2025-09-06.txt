Is it really about 10,000 hours or ten years anymore?

・Malcolm Gladwell, in his book *Outliers*, wrote that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become world-class in any field. 
In contrast, another perspective suggests, "If you do one thing every day for ten years, you'll definitely become proficient."

When I discussed this idea, someone said, "I don't think it's about the time—10,000 hours or ten years. I think it's about the number of times you do it." At the time, this concept was so fresh to me that I couldn't fully grasp it, but instinctively, I felt inclined to agree.

Now, I think I understand. The idea of 10,000 hours or ten years treats time like a flat surface—it's a uniform, monotonous way of thinking. In comparison, the idea of "number of times," as suggested, includes the variations that naturally arise. Humans can't repeat something uniformly each time. We inevitably get bored with the same repetitions and feel compelled to try something different with each attempt.

What you gain from the 10,000-hour or ten-year approach might be the technique for producing something reliably mistake-free (like envisioning an endless green field of rice paddies). But when it comes to a "staggering number of times," new neural pathways are constantly formed to execute the task. Naturally, this would include failures and misses (imagine a chaotic forest with a dinosaur standing within it).

We're no longer in an era of mass-producing homogeneous, error-free items. Instead, we're in a time where one big hit can make up for all the misses. For that, the key is to try many small things frequently. Getting help from AI is certainly an option, and trying things you anticipate might fail is also an important part of the process. Before reaching ten years or 10,000 hours, you might just stumble upon a big success. It's crucial to keep that possibility vividly in mind as you proceed.
