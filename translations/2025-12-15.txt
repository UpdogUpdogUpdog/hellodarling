In Memory of Tsutaju

・Yesterday marked the finale of the year-long historical drama. For the past year, I've met with Tsutaya Jūzaburō every week, and now he's finally gone to the afterlife. There was no grand battle, no sword-fighting scenes. Most of it unfolded within the town of Edo and Edo Castle, so it might have been unsatisfying for those who crave epic tales. But for me, this entire year has been a delight, spent in the company of Tsutaju. It feels as though I've lost the chance to meet with a dear friend. Tsutaju, you were always pondering, "Isn't there something we can do?" no matter what the situation. That's what I loved about you. It wasn't so much about strategy or tactics, but rather the way you approached things with the determination of a cornered mouse biting a cat. That was what made it intriguing. I wish I could have spent more time with you.

I mean, really—he was only 47 when he passed, and the cause was beriberi. In today's world, we know it's a vitamin deficiency, not something life-threatening. But back then, things were different. It wasn't just beriberi; many illnesses that are manageable now were not back then. Even when I reflect on my own life, I've done so much more after the age he left us. Thinking of him as a "friend," it truly is a shame.

"Life is short, but art is long"—how true that is. Indeed, what Tsutaju left behind still lives on today, but I can't help but think that if Tsutaya Jūzaburō had lived past 48, there would have been more things he might have accomplished. He's a historical figure, a character in a drama, and the factual conclusions have already been drawn.

Yet, despite being a stranger from over two hundred years ago, I still find myself wondering if there wasn't "something more we could have done." It must be that Tsutaya Jūzaburō holds a special place in my heart. Well, at the very least, with the help of modern medicine and whatnot, I'm not planning on dying any time soon—I intend to keep going strong.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. As long as life remains interesting, it's better to keep on living.
