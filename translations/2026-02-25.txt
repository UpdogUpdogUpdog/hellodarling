On the Persistent Mystery of the "Unknown"
Shigesato Itoi

・In the "Hobonichi 5-Year Diary" entry for February 23, 2024,

　■Though it's not an abandonment of reason,
　I wonder if things we truly "understand" have any power left.
　It's only the "unknown," the things we can't tear our eyes away from,
　that truly grow.

　I wrote that. For the past two years, I've been pondering this notion.
　Now, with the widespread presence of ChatGPT, this feeling has only intensified.
　I understand that being able to explain things is fundamental to communication.
　Surely, society relies on this very foundation.
　What exactly I envisioned when I referred to "the unknown" two years ago,
　I couldn't say now.

　So, if I reconsider this concept, what if I apply the phrase "someone you love" here?
　No matter how clear the reasons, the worth, or the meaning of loving someone become,
　what does it really matter?
　Perhaps, the feeling of loving someone needs no understanding, nor would understanding more change anything.
　Focusing on the "unknown," the things you can't look away from, is what nurtures them.

　And here I am, casually throwing this out there, but you know,
　the "unknown" often gets treated like it’s as good as nonexistent.
　When "the unknown" is reframed as "something that will eventually be understood" or
　"something that should really be understood," and explained cleverly,
　people nod along, saying, "Oh, now I get it."
　But, truly, even if it's acknowledged, it doesn't really matter.
　In reality, everything wonderful is "unknown."
　Thanks for sticking with me this far.
