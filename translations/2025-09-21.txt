Getting Better at Worrying  
by Shigesato Itoi

・People often toss out the saying, "It's easier done than said," with a casual air. When you hear it, you might think, "Yeah, I guess so," or mumble, "That's easy for you to say." But if you take a moment to reflect, consider this: humanity has continued to "give birth to as many people as there are." Each person, no doubt, has their own anxieties and fears. Back in the day, infant mortality rates were even higher than now. Yet here we are, worrying and all, because we were indeed born. Whether said lightly or with deep thought, "It's easier done than said" holds a certain truth.

Similarly, when it comes to various jobs and professions, people often discuss how challenging they are. "I work in some aspect of the railway industry," and that's tough, isn't it? "I'm in the minor league of professional baseball," that's challenging, right? "I'm a full-time housewife," now that's really demanding. "I'm a teacher," oh, that must be difficult. "I work at the ward office," "I run a Chinese restaurant," "I perform acrobatics in the circus," "I'm an idol,"—it seems like everything is tough. I try to understand the struggles and the expertise required for each job; I'm genuinely interested. However, when the focus is solely on "It's hard," "I'm struggling," "I can't do it," I can't help but feel there's more to the story. Sure, there are people who aren't suited for certain tasks or work under harsh conditions, but if it were only about being difficult, no one would do these jobs. Even ramen shops, which must be tough to run, are everywhere. Regardless of their success, there are plenty of them. We need to recognize that "surprisingly, it's doable." Even what I do is challenging in its own way (laughs). Yet, the fact is, I'm managing somehow. "Worrying alone won't give birth," and "indeed, things do get done." We should incorporate this perspective more into our thinking.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. I believe it's natural to think, "Somehow, it's working out."
