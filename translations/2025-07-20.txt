Like a True Movie Buff  
Shigesato Itoi

・On the day I had a gastroscopy, while still under the lingering effects of anesthesia, I found myself at the movie theater. For three hours, I sat there, not even taking a bathroom break, completely absorbed by the screen. That surely means I found it fascinating. However, the medication might have left me a bit dazed. Wanting to watch it more attentively, I decided to get a ticket to see it again.

Moreover, I realized I hadn't seen any films by this director since "Hula Girls." I knew he had made gripping films like "Villain" and "Rage," but I hadn't watched them. So, I resolved to seize this opportunity and watch them all at once. I decided to watch "Villain" and "Rage" on my TV at home. In other words, over three days, I watched "Villain," "Rage," and "Kokuhaku" back-to-back. Doesn't that sound just like something a movie buff would do? I never intended to, but I ended up behaving like a true movie fan.

To sum it up, I'm glad I watched them consecutively. Especially with "Villain"—even though it's a bit late—I’m thankful I didn't miss it. I discovered that the collaboration between the director and the author, Shūichi Yoshida, continued through these three films. It was fascinating to see such an ongoing relationship between a writer and a director.

After watching "Kokuhaku" for the second time, I came home and started writing this piece. First, I was amazed that the final screening at 11:15 PM in Roppongi Hills' Screen 9 (a decent-sized theater) was completely full. Since a certain era in the Shōwa period, I hadn't witnessed a packed movie theater. Yet, "Kokuhaku" managed to achieve that. It was a film in demand by many. I enjoyed it even more the second time around. As a three-hour piece of entertainment, it was exceptionally well-crafted. With both depth and breadth, it naturally drew people in. Even those who aren't movie aficionados can find it genuinely enjoyable.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. I'll discuss the content further on "Hobo Nikkan" at a later date.
