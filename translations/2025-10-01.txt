This Is the Change of Seasons  
Shigesato Itoi

・When you can't think of anything to say, talking about the weather is always a safe bet.  
   Or so they tell us, but it doesn't quite work that way, does it?  
   What exactly are you supposed to discuss about the weather?  
   "Lovely weather we're having," or "Such unfortunate weather,"—these are fine for passing exchanges on the street.  
   But to write about it here, well, that wouldn't hold anyone's interest, would it?  
   At the very least, I need you to think, "Oh, that's true," or there's no point in writing at all.

I'm still suspicious that we might get another hot day, but let's be honest, we will.  
Days reaching 30 degrees in October don't surprise me anymore. Thirty degrees? No problem.  
What surprises me more is the talk of the disappearing four seasons.  
Yet here we are, naturally feeling the chill in the air.  
I'm living through it, sneezing and all.  
During the day, the air conditioning is on, but come evening, it's chilly.  
Even among the "Almost Daily" team, quite a few are under the weather.  
The change of seasons has arrived, hasn't it?  
Grasses and ragweed are kicking up their pollen.  
I'm definitely feeling the shift in my body.  
To put it bluntly, I'm not in great shape.  
I think I might have a cold, but my temperature reads normal.  
There's this odd cough, a runny nose, and a general sense of lethargy.  
I'm not in the best mood either.  
When I lie back on the sofa, I can't keep my eyes open—I just want to sleep.  
Yet, when I switch into work mode, I can manage to seem lively to others.  
And then it hits me, I go through this every year during this season.

Just a short while ago, my body was on high alert, preparing for the heat.  
Now, suddenly, it's asking, "Are you ready for the cold?"  
Caught off guard, I'm hesitating, unsure how to respond.  
Just like the mind has its "mental preparation,"  
the body must have its "physical preparation," I'm sure of it.  
How are you feeling as you read this?  
I hope you're enjoying some pleasant autumn sunshine.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today.  
Ah, come to think of it, it's already October, isn't it?
