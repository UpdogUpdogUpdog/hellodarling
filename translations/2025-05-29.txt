Here is the translation:

"That was so much fun."

When the sun comes out on a hot day, I start thinking about the rainy season and how summer is already here. It's still May, but I can't help it. For some reason, the word "pool" always makes me think of summer. The school pool, the public pool I rode my bike to. Either way, I just loved going to the pool. What was so much fun about it? Was it the joy of swimming or the thrill of getting in the water? Neither, really. If I were to interview my past self, I'm not sure what I'd say. 

But somehow, I just felt like it was so much fun. That kind of joy disappeared when I grew up. What a shame.

Just saying "pool!" was enough to make me happy. That's how happy I was. We'd climb trees with friends, play tag, and play catch. I'm not even sure what made it so much fun. It was all so simple, and the games we played were hardly exciting. But we didn't care what we were doing, as long as we were playing. We didn't need money or special equipment; we could play all day. 

When the teacher said, "Today's PE is at the pool," the excitement in the room was palpable, and I wanted to be a part of it. Even if summer was too hot and the cicadas didn't sing, summer was still coming. Even adults would say, "Let's play!" now and then. Thanks for coming to "almost summer" today.

By the way, "playful people" refers to kids, doesn't it?
