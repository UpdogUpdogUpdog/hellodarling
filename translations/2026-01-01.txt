2026 is just beginning, with 364 days still to go.

Usually, I start writing this piece on the morning of the day it's due. You can't just end with a single line saying, "Happy New Year," so I find myself in a sort of warm-up mode, casually browsing through my phone or watching TV, trying to figure out what to write. Around New Year's Eve, people start dropping "words of wisdom." They share reflective thoughts to wrap up the year and new insights for the year ahead, which makes me feel like I should get into the spirit, too. Maybe I should say something New Year-like, or perhaps offer a piece of wisdom that doesn't necessarily scream "New Year." Either way, I'm not in my usual mindset, so it’s not working. I just can't get started.

Despite it being New Year's Day, the beginning of 2026—a wonderfully odd-numbered year, the Year of the Horse, with each horse ready to burst out of the gate—and even though I've prepared the black beans and red bean paste earlier than usual this year, here I am hesitating over what to write. But when it comes to what I want to accomplish this year, I actually have a lot planned. I might have a clearer vision of what I want to do than in most years. Sometimes people ask me, "Mr. Itoi, do you have more free time now that you're not the president anymore?" and when I reply, "No, not really," they look surprised. Since I’m diving deeper into creative work, something I’m naturally inclined towards, I end up busier than ever. However, the things I look forward to are more visible now. Whether it goes smoothly or I'm met with challenges, I've granted myself permission to be a bit reckless, and this freedom and spontaneity are what make it interesting.

Today is 2026, and it will still be 2026 tomorrow and the day after. I plan to make this entire year, 2026, a fun ride. Both "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" and I are quite energetic, so we'll keep at it with perseverance.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Eikichi Yazawa also announced his 2026 tour. That's good, really good.
