Translation:
"All humans are middle school students."

I sometimes see various people as middle school students, even though I don't always do so. No matter if they're 80 years old, 40 years old, or 25 years old, I think everyone ends up being middle school students. Even the prime minister or heroes, or people who do bad things, or those who seem smart and knowledgeable, or respectable researchers, artists, or wise old men, or town mayors, or ramen shop owners, or athletes - I think they're all middle school students. 

Middle school students repeat the process of studying, making friends, practicing, struggling, and dropping out. As a result, they become the people we see today. I don't think it's ridiculous to view people as middle school students. It's just that I think everyone is a middle school student. I think that's why each person has worked hard and persevered, maybe even acquiring a sense of majesty or pressure. But ultimately, I think it's all the same. Because, you see, the essence is that of a middle school student. 

I greatly admire Shohei Ohtani, and I have great respect for Shuntaro Tanikawa. I've long admired Nagashima Shigeo. I think Yokoo Tadanori is an artist who will be remembered for centuries. I've learned many things from Ryumei Yoshimoto. I'm looking forward to Naoya Inoue's next match. As for Eikichi Yazawa, I'm like his loyal follower. But despite all this, I can still see everyone's middle school student face. That's probably because there's a middle school student inside each person. If someone were to ask the Buddha or Jesus, they'd probably say, "Ah, that person is a middle school student too!" If I had to say it in a cool way, I'd say "Super Middle School Student." You and I, of course, are middle school students too. I can picture us all being in the same classroom. Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. There are also middle school students who deny being middle school students, saying "I'm not a middle school student!"
