The Imagination of the Unimaginable  
Shigesato Itoi

・Suddenly, I found myself alone in the desert.  
  You've probably seen a movie like that.  
  "Suddenly, I found myself" in some scene.  
  It's a moment of panic, no mental preparation,  
  clueless about what to do or how things got there.  
  Even if you're alone in the desert or whisked away on a prince's white horse,  
  you might think you could figure out the next step,  
  but this is a real dilemma.  
  →→ "I was speeding down a ski jump."  
  What do I do now? I can't even fall to stop myself.  
  Racing down a 31-degree slope at 120 kilometers per hour.  
  You can't make any decisions about falling or sliding.  
  This is quite the predicament, I think,  
  as I watch.

  There are plenty of events where you spin mid-air while falling,  
  or races where you rush down bumpy slopes.  
  This doesn't connect to anything in my own experience.  
  I remember trying skiing a bit as a kid.  
  I remember rolling around in the snow.  
  But who has ever spun in the air?  
  Even if someone told me to spin in the air, I think it's impossible.  
  If you've driven a car at 100 kilometers on a freeway,  
  you can imagine an F1 race at 300 kilometers and think,  
  "I can't even imagine, but it must be amazing."  
  But strapping a board to your feet and spinning multiple times in the air,  
  I can't even imagine "I can't even imagine."  
  And, everyone, listen up!  
  The 1440-degree spins we see on live broadcasts,  
  we're almost watching them in "slow motion," you know!  
  Even if you watch it in real-time, you can't tell what's happening.  
  We exclaim "Whoa!" or "Scary!" but in truth,  
  we're just marveling, left in a state of "What's going on?"

  They're using equipment and aided by snow and ice,  
  but what humans can do, pushing beyond human understanding,  
  has reached such incredible heights.  
  (I'm sure it's the same outside of sports, too.)

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today.  
Everything is becoming so specialized that it's beyond comprehension.
