I've been watching a withered tree.

・As winter sets in, some trees have shed all their leaves. Their bare branches, like a river standing upright, cast beautiful shadows in the sunlight. The branches above ground mirror the intricate web of roots sprawling beneath the earth.

I just compared that sight to a river, but it seems trees are also like rivers flowing skyward. When the cold arrives and the leaves have all fallen, trees draw up far less water. On sunny summer days, they can absorb and transpire between 200 to 500 liters of water from their roots to their leaves. Even though plants remain still, they live by absorbing and moving vast amounts of water.

For humans, various theories exist, but it seems we require about 2.5 liters of water daily. Our bodies are made up of 60% water, and we continuously use it to live. It's easy to picture when you think about how 80% of our blood is water. Moreover, if you linked all the blood vessels in a human body, they'd stretch 90,000 to 100,000 kilometers—enough to circle the earth two and a half times. As I researched, I found it even more fascinating that blood takes only 20 to 50 seconds to complete a round trip from the heart throughout the body and back.

We humans are walking trees. Paraphrasing Pascal, we are thinking reeds. We're also rivers that laugh, cry, sing, and dance. Oh, and when I think about it, even the dog sleeping at my feet is a bit of a thinking reed, and though it doesn't laugh or cry much, it's a barking, walking river.

In the poem "Palms to the Sun" by Takashi Yanase, there's a line about how "we're all alive," and it's true that a current of flowing water exists within us. I write this while sipping water, just before heading for a bath.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today. May you drink abundantly (water), keep things flowing, and live fully today.
