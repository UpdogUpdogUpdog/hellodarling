The Coolness of Being Considerate  
by Shigesato Itoi

・You know those people who are naturally considerate?  
   I find myself admiring them.  
   There's just something undeniably cool about it, right?

   It's like the "cold hand towel" you get at a restaurant.  
   But even among cold hand towels, there's a range.  
   There's the kind that feels exceptionally thoughtful,  
   and then there are those that don't quite hit the mark.  
   Being considerate is a bit more complex than that.  
   There's the kind of "considerate" that wants to be recognized,  
   and then there's the kind that doesn't mind going unnoticed.  
   It's the latter—the unnoticed kind of consideration—that I really appreciate.  
   Maybe I'm being a bit convoluted here.

   In today's world, everything seems to run on "give and take,"  
   or the idea of equivalent exchange and contracts.  
   People are eager to point out, "I just did something considerate for you, see?"  
   They want to emphasize the value they've provided.  
   And sure, that's fine. If you give something, you expect to be compensated.  
   But the world isn't built solely on that principle.  
   There's a kind of giving that doesn't expect anything in return.  
   It's about forgetting the need for reciprocation or recognition,  
   and simply doing something because you want to.  
   The coolness of being considerate lies in that realm, I think.  
   The "considerate" person's intent is silently directed at others.  
   It's the kind of coolness that comes from wanting to do something for someone.  
   Perhaps it's akin to the old Edo period's concept of "iki"—a refined sense of style and grace.

   And while we're at it, there's something that comes to mind—  
   it's kind of like unrequited love.  
   In a way, unrequited love is incredibly cool.
