To Sixth Graders, and to Myself  
Shigesato Itoi

・Today marks the final installment of this series.  
　When asked by a group of sixth graders at an elementary school at the foot of Mount Akagi, I agreed to answer their questions, though I wasn't confident in my ability to do so.  
　Why did I do it? I suppose I wanted to dive into such a situation.  
　The initial motivation, it seems, was the impression that "adults don't seem to be having much fun."  
　Thinking back, when I was a child, I also thought, "Becoming an adult and working seems tough and unpleasant."  
　Yet, after entering the real world, despite my complaints about how tiresome or bothersome things can be, I find I'm actually enjoying myself more than I expected.  
　I hoped that today's elementary school kids might think, even just a little, "Hey, maybe it can be fun."  
　When I listened to them on the day, it was clear that the children harbored a lot of worries.  
　I felt sorry for them, as if their concerns were my own.  
　It's like when you give a little push on the back to help a kid master the horizontal bar at the playground.  
　Once they manage to pull themselves up, they feel great.  
　That moment of realizing, "Oh, I can do this," is important.  
　Anyone can play that supportive role, really.  
　Looking back, both the past and present versions of myself have always worried more than necessary.  
　Even now, the recurring nightmares I have are about "missing a flight because I can't get my luggage sorted" and "being stuck on stage during a dramatic recitation."  
　I keep dreaming about the same kinds of failures.  
　Perhaps those worries persist because I'm not good at those things.  
　But you know, the things you can't do well yourself, someone else skilled can help you with—that's society.  
　It's not about doing everything alone; that's why things work out.  
　Unlike school tests, which you must tackle solo, in the real world, it's okay to get help and learn from others.

　We come to know a lot of fears, worries, and shortcomings.  
　But these aren't things to constantly hold and examine.  
　This is something I want to tell sixth graders, and myself too.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
There are people today who are adept at packing luggage and performing on stage.
