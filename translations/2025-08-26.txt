Satoru Iwata's Computer Class  
Shigesato Itoi

・Looking back, during the time when I was creating games, I personally hadn't yet delved into the world of computers. Everyone around me, of course, relied heavily on computers for their work. Occasionally, someone would show me a "PC game," but it never piqued my interest much. I'd just nod and say, "Oh, I see."

I was working on games with a team, and Iwata offered to be my computer tutor, with the caveat being, "if you're interested, Itoi-san." My interest was there, albeit weakly, so I accepted his offer. Iwata seemed to think that having a computer might open up more "possibilities" for me. His suggestion was to use the computer to assist with writing. There was a tool he mentioned for this purpose, though I can't recall its name now. Essentially, it was a method of breaking down thoughts into "major categories, subcategories, and smaller categories," and by adding or removing elements, it made ideas clearer and easier to understand.

I would respond with "I see," giving the teacher good feedback, but truthfully, I was a student who didn't find the process particularly exciting. While this tool was undoubtedly useful for Iwata's writing, I felt like if I had to write in that structured way, I'd lose my desire to write altogether. I was a pretty lousy, rebellious student in that regard. Sometimes I do write using a similar method, but it's not something I enjoy doing often. And although I didn't mind spending time with Iwata, there was no second session of that "computer class." My genuine interest in computers only sparked when I discovered the internet—a web of humans and information intertwined.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. I think many of you may have had a similar experience.
