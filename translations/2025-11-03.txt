Unreliable people, in truth, can often be quite dependable.

・At "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun," we frequently put out a call for "HELP." It's less a cry for rescue and more a request for a helping hand. Each crew member has their own tasks and a rough idea of their schedule, but sometimes we leap beyond these plans to answer a colleague's call for "HELP." These requests transcend job titles and hierarchies. It could be something as simple as a truck arriving in front of the office that needs unloading, and we need three hands to get the job done. Or perhaps something unexpected crops up on the ground, and we're suddenly short-staffed. That's when we reach out to those who weren't originally on the schedule. When a polished POP display is needed on the spot, we'll ask a designer for assistance. These calls for "HELP" occur quite spontaneously, cutting across various roles and situations.

I often observe these scenes, and recently, in a spirit of encouragement, I've come up with this little comment:

● Even if you think, "I'm not dependable," we are truly grateful for your help. You will surely prove to be reliable!

This is genuinely true. People with kind hearts often worry that their lack of expertise or experience might be a burden. But regardless of how awkward or inexperienced you may feel, just having someone there can be immensely valuable. Whether it's house-sitting, running an errand, or standing guard—tasks you'd assign to a child—when hands are scarce, these are roles that specialists would have to juggle alongside their duties. The impact of a "I can handle at least this much" attitude is incredible. Those who claim to be "unreliable" often turn out to be surprisingly dependable. They've been a tremendous help all along.

Thank you for coming to "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Even in places where no balls seem to fly, someone is always there, guarding the field.
