Is one's life truly their own?  
Shigesato Itoi

・I touched on this yesterday as well, but in the historical drama, Tsutaya Jūzaburō, at the tender age of 47, succumbed to beriberi and passed away shortly thereafter.

Thinking back to when I was around the same age, right before turning 50 and starting "Hobo Nikkan," I was encouraged by seasoned entrepreneurs to get a full health check-up. Until then, I hadn't thought much about illness, but there was a part of me that felt it was uncool to worry excessively about health. Of course, that was the folly of youth, but if I dig deeper into my memories, I recall even considering the act of valuing one's life as somewhat uncool. Somewhere in my mind, I believed there were things more important than life itself. There might be a sliver of philosophical truth in that, but it's certainly not something a young, naive person should flippantly claim. Though I never voiced it, I held the belief that my life, my body, belonged to me alone, and it was up to me to decide what to do with them (it's foolish, I know, but I can't simply erase what I once thought).

The person who encouraged me to get that health check-up probably wanted to convey, without explicitly saying it, that "your life and body aren't yours alone." My being alive and healthy is also for the sake of those who live alongside me. This includes my family and my colleagues at work. If something were to happen to the life and body I considered mine, it would cause trouble for everyone. It could even affect the families of my colleagues. Back then, I didn't explain this much to myself either, but from that moment on, I stopped thinking of my life and health as solely mine to handle as I pleased. I wish I could have discussed this with Jūzaburō, who passed away at 47. He was the kind of man who would have understood, especially at that age.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
Those who treat themselves carelessly likely can't truly care for others.
