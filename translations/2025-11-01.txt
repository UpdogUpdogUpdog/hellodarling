The feeling of self-worth is a wonderful thing.

I've mentioned this here many times before, but I often find myself wishing I had been raised with more praise. People from my generation didn’t hear many compliments growing up. Even when we did something well or achieved good grades, we were reminded, "You're not there yet, there’s always someone better, don’t get complacent." We were brought up with this constant admonition. It meant that whether things went well or not, praise was a rarity. I don’t think my parents were bad by any means. Even if I didn’t study or perform well, they didn’t scold me, but I do remember not being praised. Perhaps the only form of education was to warn us against getting too full of ourselves. I simply accepted that as the way things were. Interestingly, adults other than teachers or parents were much more likely to commend me, which was nice, but I would instinctively remind myself, "Don’t let it go to your head." Looking back, it seems such a waste. The so-called "self-worth" of children like me, who grew up in that older era, is low, and I attribute that to the education we received at the time. In a way, it may have appeared to foster humility, so perhaps the educational outcomes were considered successful. Yet, there's this perpetual undertone of "It’s not good enough, I’m worried" that resonates deep within, making it hard to break free and run joyfully. If I've ever managed to do that, it’s because I worked hard to overcome it, truly.

Because of the way I was raised, I might overcompensate by frequently praising others. I genuinely admire and am impressed by people, and I just want to express that. Since I started "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun," I’ve found it much easier to compliment the team, and I feel that’s been a really positive thing. Honestly, I think everyone’s growing beautifully.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Now, let’s open the door. I’m excited!
