The Child Inside the Adult  
Shigesato Itoi

・In the realm of the internet, there's a term "the person inside" that used to float around. I always thought it was an oddly fitting expression. It seems like you don't hear it much anymore, but suddenly, it struck me: inside every adult, there's a child. An adult is, of course, an adult, yet within them dwells a child who seeks satisfaction, even as the adult outwardly maintains a mature demeanor and language.

I'm not here to judge whether this is good or bad. If you can recognize the presence of the child inside you and think, "Ah, there you are," then maybe that's a sign of being quite grown-up. You don't want to make that inner child cry, right? But letting them run wild could be dangerous. That's what I've been thinking.

・Come to think of it, I've long had a habit of picturing most people as if they were classmates from my middle school days. Whether they're distinguished professors or big-name celebrities, everyone has passed through that middle school phase. I find myself wondering what kind of face they had back then, how their classmates saw them, or how they spent their days. Even without delving too deeply, can't you sort of picture it? Sure, sometimes I'm off the mark, but if you consider that most people's essence is still that of a middle schooler (and let's face it, I'm just one of them too), it makes everyone seem so much more approachable. Most of the time, I think, "Ah, I remember someone like this!" From there, personalities and virtues are crafted by adding or subtracting layers. But no matter how much they embellish or exaggerate, it's mostly rooted in "that person you saw in the middle school classroom."

And as a little extra thought, just like the child inside adults, there are adults and even elderly folks inside children too.
