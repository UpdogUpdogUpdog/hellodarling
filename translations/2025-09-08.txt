Manga is Possibility, Osamu Tezuka is Extraordinary  
Shigesato Itoi

・For about a year now, I've been pondering the possibilities of manga. In both narrow and broad senses, manga is incredible. While I do plan to start something soon, the most important thing is to keep an open mind. If you find yourself delving into questions like "What is manga?" or trying to become an expert on every manga out there, that's a dangerous path. It's crucial to create an environment for experimentation driven by curiosity—an "I don't really get it, but it's fascinating" kind of interest. After all, "Hobo Nikkan" also started from such ambiguity.

That said, the existence of the giant that is Osamu Tezuka is truly something else. It's not a case of making lighthearted jokes about how you can't ignore this "bug" of a man. Even recently, in a morning drama modeled after Takashi Yanase, a character inspired by Osamu Tezuka came to request some work. From back then, he was already a genius, a giant in the manga world. He's the kind of person who appears as a giant in other people's stories. Even after his passing, when people talk about him, they often mention the theme song of "Astro Boy" as his signature work. Tanikawa himself referred to it as "my most well-known poem," almost as if it were someone else's work. The producer who commissioned that theme song was none other than Osamu Tezuka, the creator of "Astro Boy." In the story of Shuntaro Tanikawa, Tezuka was an important figure. And, of course, the sheer amount of "emotion" and "joy" that Osamu Tezuka, the manga artist, brought is something that can be expressed both in numbers and in everyone's memories.

As someone who grew up on Tezuka's manga, I, in my youthful arrogance, used to keep some distance from this man who had become an undeniable legend. The only flaw was that it was a given he was "amazing." However, as I've grown older, I've come to truly understand just how extraordinary Tezuka was. He could draw so well, had such a gift for envisioning stories, was inventive, and could produce a vast amount of work in little time—he was, quite frankly, a "god" in that sense. Especially now, having seen his original artwork, I'm once again astounded by the "life" imbued in it. Thanks to him, manga has become something truly remarkable today.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Resisting the notion of "of course he's amazing" is just a part of being young.
