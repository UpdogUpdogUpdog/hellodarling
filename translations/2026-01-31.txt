The Woman Called Mother and Her Child  
Shigesato Itoi

・A friend's mother passed away, and I read some writing about it. The piece was written not long after her passing, and it felt as if the words still carried a warmth, so much so that I shed a few tears. To me, she was a stranger, perhaps, but there was something profoundly important between the mother and child that touched me deeply. It was a sad thing, yet I couldn't help but feel a tinge of envy.

Just a little earlier, I had met with a different friend who mentioned that among boys who had done various "bad things," those who had even a single memory of being loved by someone could recover more easily. Often, that someone is the mother. Hearing such stories, I can't help but think "How nice," and feel a little envious.

It might seem strange for a grown adult, or even an old man, but there's nothing I love more than seeing a mother and child getting along. I watch my daughter and her daughter with admiration. Even my boss and his mother evoke a touch of longing in me. Since I never had a relationship with my own mother, I've spent a long time practicing being "okay" with its absence. However, as I've grown older, perhaps I've become more honest. The idea of a mother who loves unconditionally—it's something I've come to see as truly wonderful. A child being hugged tightly by their mother, indulging in their whims—is there anything more blissful? I have no memories like that. But I don't want pity; rather, I just want to tell myself, "You did well." If I'm the only one to say it, that's enough.

Mothers, children, those who love and are loved: I want to say, that is truly a magnificent treasure.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today. For some reason today, I'm sending this without rereading it—because if I do, I'll just end up deleting it.
