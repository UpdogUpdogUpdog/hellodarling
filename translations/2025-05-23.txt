Translation:

The phrase "Events occur because of your weaknesses" is especially fitting here. 

I came to Kyoto as the presenter for the "Music Awards Japan 2025" and handed out the "Ruby" trophies to the winners. Until the very moment, the staff didn't know who the winners were, and even my presence on stage was a secret. So, I couldn't announce it or share the news until today. That's just how it goes. This kind of role comes with a script, and you have to follow it step by step. You have to walk to a certain point, stop, turn around, bow, and say your lines. The next thing you know, the introductory video will start playing, and you have to say your part as if you're improvising. Don't worry, everything is written on the teleprompter, so just read it. Yes, the font is large enough for old eyes or nearsighted eyes to read. Then, you open the envelope and read out the winner's name after a brief pause. You have to do at least that much.

However, I'm really bad at reproducing what's been decided upon. It's like a disease. On recent TV shows, even the lines that the talent seems to come up with on the spot are often scripted. Luckily, my own greetings weren't written in the script, so that was good. But in cases like that, I have to think about what to say beforehand, which I carelessly forgot. I was too focused on the script and lost my confidence and composure. The director told me, "Don't worry, it'll be on the teleprompter, so you'll be fine," with a smile, and I tried to reassure myself, but my mind went blank on stage. The digital teleprompter disappeared, and I didn't have my greetings prepared, so everything fell apart. As they say, "Events occur because of your weaknesses."

I'm not going to try to turn my weaknesses into strengths at my age, but it seems like my life with thrills will continue. Thank you for coming to "Almost Daily" today.

By the way, the musicians who participated in this music festival were really passionate about their craft.

 Footnote: 〈不得意なことにこそ、事件は起こる。〉 means "Events occur because of your weaknesses." It's a Japanese idiom that suggests that unexpected events often arise from one's weaknesses or areas where one is not skilled.
