To Myself  
Shigesato Itoi

・Putting what I've felt into words doesn't come easily. I know I've felt something, but capturing it is another matter.

And when it comes to what I've thought, it only becomes words when it finally takes shape as words. I'm certain I'm thinking deeply, though.

Eventually, tracing the path of my thoughts to understand what I'm truly contemplating is a challenge. I seem to be pondering a lot, yet it's elusive.

Still, without first feeling, nothing begins. The hardest thing to express in words is feeling itself. Without words, it might seem like I haven't felt anything at all, but that's not true—feeling is its own thing. We shouldn't force feelings into words.

I believe we shouldn't force feelings into words. When we try to do so, we end up borrowing whatever words are nearby. The words we borrow on a whim belong to someone else. If they happen to fit perfectly, that's fine, but if they're merely adequate, then they aren't truly ours.

Borrowing words freely is fine in itself. Borrowed words can combine in various ways to become something unique to us. However, if we randomly string together borrowed words, what remains is an empty shell of language that suits no one. In such cases, perhaps it's better to stay silent.

Whether I've truly felt something or not, I can understand that much without words. If I realize I've felt something, it's okay to leave it as it is. When the shape of words becomes clear, I'll remember it. Of course, there's absolutely no need to tell anyone.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today. I think what I feel when I'm in a good mood is what shapes me.
