I'm truly grateful that my teachers became teachers.

・Not just "sensei" as an honorific, but those who have taken up teaching as a profession. Oh, right—there's the word "educator." I believe I'm not alone in feeling thankful to teachers; there are probably quite a few of us. Time and again, I've thought, "I'm so glad that teacher was there."

But when I say, "I'm glad they were there," I realize that teachers aren't born as teachers. They chose to become teachers, to take up the profession of educating. Sure, there are probably many who might say, "I never intended to become a teacher," or "I had no choice," or even "It was a mistake." I wonder how many embarked on teaching with the ambition, "I'm going to be a great educator." Perhaps there are quite a few who thought, "Being a teacher might not be so bad." And honestly, that's more than enough.

Once they start, they might find it quite challenging, or they might develop an interest, thinking it’s actually fascinating. They might grow to enjoy nurturing and teaching others, feel their own growth, and through this journey, they somehow become teachers in the truest sense. There’s no job that's entirely easy, yet teaching has its mountains, valleys, rivers, and deserts to navigate. And what they teach and nurture is quite abundant. This is all because they chose to become teachers.

In truth, this isn't just about teachers. It's something that applies to all professions that people take on. Thanks to those who diligently do jobs they didn't necessarily start out loving, the world keeps turning, and many people benefit from this. Today, though, is a day I want to say thank you to teachers.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. And, of course, I've had my share of unpleasant teachers too (laughs).
