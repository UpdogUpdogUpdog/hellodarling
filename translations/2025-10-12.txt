・People often crave to do exactly what they shouldn't be doing.

　When you're in one of those times, you know exactly what you should be doing.

　The answer is simple: just do what needs to be done. If you know what that is, then go for it.

　But then again, is what you think you should be doing truly the thing you should be doing right now?

　If you're always doing what you "should," aren't you just like a machine working towards some purpose?

　Speaking of which, a machine without a purpose is a sad thing. Is there a machine that moves on without knowing what it's meant to do?

　There might be machines that keep doing something even when they have no idea what they're supposed to do.

　Those are the clockwork toys. Their purpose is to be watched or played with.

　Oh, so even clockwork toys have a purpose. But what about a carousel spinning without an audience?

　Alongside the wooden horses carrying people around, there are others spinning without riders.

　Oh, riderless wooden horses, if you have no role, why not just wander off to graze on some grass?

　Yet, those horses must remain there. It's not the time for them to be off munching on grass.

　I've managed to muddle through times when I shouldn't be doing something by slowly stringing words together.
