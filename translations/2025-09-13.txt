The Law of Universal Gravitation is fascinating.

It's said that Newton came up with the idea after watching an apple fall from a tree. I always thought that might not actually be true, but there's apparently a record of Newton himself recounting it that way. Well, if that's what he said, then so be it.

Regardless, the concept of "universal gravitation" is truly remarkable. Trying to explain to a child that it's not just about things falling, but about mutual attraction, is no easy feat. Most likely, they'll just memorize that "Earth has gravity." As adults, we understand it’s not just that simple. We come to realize, "The apple has gravity too." Compared to Earth's gravity, it's negligible—so tiny you might dismiss it entirely—but the apple indeed has its own gravitational pull. Earth, apples, dust, and particles—all possess gravity. That’s why Newton called it "universal (!) gravitation." We learned that it’s "proportional to the mass of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them," and it was even on our tests. Truly, remarkable minds conceive extraordinary ideas.

Perhaps thanks to Newton, the idea of "universal gravitation" sparks yet another kind of imagination. I often find myself imagining that there's a sort of "universal gravitation" beyond just objects. Take, for example, events that draw crowds. A large-scale event has a strong gravitational pull. If you're chosen as the opening act, you end up attracting a considerable number of people already drawn to the main event, even if your own mass is small. People with power, fame, or wealth have "mass" and thus exert a strong gravitational pull. Sometimes, the gathered people and money combine, increasing the mass even further. There are those who might not seem to have much mass but possess significant gravitational pull, while others appear massive yet lack the necessary mass to exert much gravity. Projects, too, can have strong or weak gravitational pulls. When you think about it, being attracted by gravity is also a manifestation of force. Continually being drawn in and combining to increase mass is something that happens as well.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" again today. Perhaps your "faves" are merging with idols and experiencing gravity firsthand!
