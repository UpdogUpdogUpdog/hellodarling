Even a dog that takes a walk might run into a stick.

・How should one spend the very first day of the new year?  
This question has lingered in my mind since I was a child.  
Yet, I was taught by the adults around me that "January 1st is a day for doing nothing,"  
so I would laze around at home on New Year's Day.  
The second day, I followed the same routine, doing nothing at all.  
It seemed like this is how it always was every year,  
but for the first time ever, I decided to get moving right from New Year's Day.  
The theme of the "Hobonichi Techo App," "Living is about creating memories," spurred me into action.

"I’m going for a walk," I told my boss, lacing up my sneakers.  
At the end of the year, after all that inactivity, my circulation must have been sluggish.  
Without a plan, just taking that first step could change something.

I hadn't even decided which direction to head,  
but I set off toward Aoyama Cemetery, a route I used to walk with my dog who loved walks.  
I tried to walk consciously, paying attention to my stride, and it felt good.  
Why not just keep walking as far as I can go, I thought.  
Wouldn't it be interesting to walk all the way to Hobonichi in Kanda Nishikicho?  
I knew it was quite a distance, but the question was, could I make it?  
If I did manage to reach it, I'd be curious to know which parts of me would ache,  
and how I would feel exhausted.  
Alright, if it doesn’t work out, I can always give up, but for now, forward.  
I reached Nogizaka, then Akasaka, and truthfully, even this far was tiring.  
I bought water from a vending machine near TBS, sipping as I walked.  
When Hie Shrine came into view, I took the path behind it toward Kasumigaseki.  
I walked among the guards near the Prime Minister's Residence and the National Diet Building.  
Though there were slopes and I was quite worn out,  
I started feeling like I could manage, and my feet kept moving forward.  
When the Imperial Palace came into view, my spirits soared—I was sure of reaching my goal.  
I walked alongside foreigners and joggers along the moat.  
Though I wanted to post photos on Twitter later, my iPhone ran out of battery just as I was nearing the end.  
I bought a charging set at a convenience store and managed to get it working again,  
finally arriving at Hobonichi in Kanda Nishikicho, snapping some photos.  
A taxi would have cost over 3000 yen for this distance, but I walked it all.  
I’m amazed—maybe this is how my year’s going to be.  
Right from the start of the new year, I've created a memory that feels like a first.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today.  
It was the best New Year's Day—a boost to my health, and completely free.
