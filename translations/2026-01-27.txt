Gossip and Natto  
Shigesato Itoi

・Every year, when I started using a new planner, I would write the same phrase. I kept it a secret at the time, but since I stopped doing it a few years ago, I can finally share it: "I promise not to speak ill of others." I wrote it every year, but of course, I never kept it. Inevitably, I would break the promise myself. Yes, I admit it—I talk about people behind their backs. Each year, this truth became abundantly clear.

Though I might refrain from saying anything bad on the day I wrote the promise, somewhere along the way, I would catch myself realizing, "Oh, here I am, speaking ill of someone again." Once I noticed it, the promise was already broken, and I would just resign myself with a sense of "Ah, so that's how it is." And then, the following year, I'd find myself doing the same thing all over again.

I have come to understand the situations in which I'm most prone to gossip. It's typically when others are speaking ill of me. Also, if there's someone present who might sympathize with my unspoken thoughts, I tend to voice them, craving that connection. Being around people who frequently gossip also makes it easier to join in. However, if it's someone I've disliked for a long time, I honestly don't feel the need to speak poorly of them.

I haven't kept statistics or anything, but as the years of breaking this promise went by, I realized it was impossible to stop entirely. Yet, it seems like the overall amount of gossip I engage in has decreased. Interestingly, I don't think there are many people around me who gossip excessively, which is quite impressive when I think about it.

This year, instead of writing "Don't speak ill of others" in my new Hobonichi Techo planner, I wrote, somewhat belatedly, "Eat natto every day." So far, I've been keeping up with eating natto daily. It's a light-hearted and peaceful promise, but we'll see how it goes.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. I'm off to visit a factory somewhere in Kyushu today. Heh heh heh.
