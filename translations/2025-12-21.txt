Speaking of how I work...

There's a distinct difference in how people perceive time off depending on whether they're employed by a company or working freelance. I recently read pieces by two acquaintances of mine—one a former company employee, the other always a freelancer—each reflecting on this difference. I myself worked for a small company for a bit, but when it went under, I became a freelancer. Until I started "Hobonichi," I was freelancing for about 25 years, so I think I've really internalized that way of working. However, now that I've been running "Hobonichi" for even longer, I think I've also adopted the mindset of someone who runs a company. When I consider it, my own way of working seems to blend both worlds.

Every day, I write "this" for "Hobonichi," which is hardly the norm for a company employee. Normally, you might expect a team rotation or specific writing schedules with days off in between. But when I started "Hobonichi"—whether it was a limited liability company or a corporation—I still considered myself a freelancer. So, I decided on my own, "I'm going to write every day." There was no consultation with anyone; it just happened that way. And though I officially have days off like everyone else, I'm constantly thinking about "this" and "that" and "what's next," similar to when I was freelancing. If I decide to take a break, as long as there are no prior commitments, I can take off as much time as I want. People still ask, "How often do you show up to the office, Itoi-san?" Well, unless I have work outside, I'm there every day. Of course, like the rest of the crew, I take extended breaks around the New Year and other holidays. Even during those times, I'm either playing or pondering, much like when I freelanced. This way of working just makes sense to me, so that's how it is. I'm not particularly thrilled about long holidays, nor do I dread going to the office. It's a mix of my own preferences and the company's needs.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. It's quite pleasant to have no obligatory drinking parties, business dinners, or golf outings.
