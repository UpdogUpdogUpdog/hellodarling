In this era where everyone's opinions are on display for all to see, it's interesting to think about the concept of an elephant. When I hear "elephant," I conjure up an image, assuming that most people have a similar vision. Yet, I realize this is merely my own personal interpretation. The elephant I imagine is shared only by those who think alike, and even if that's a significant number of people, there are undoubtedly others who envision something entirely different. When you put it that way, it makes perfect sense.

So, for those of you who have read this far, what kind of elephant came to your mind? Most likely, the majority have a similar image. But, of course, there are diverse perspectives. Some might think only of the trunk when they hear "elephant," imagining it as a creature with a snake-like appendage. Others might focus on its tusks, viewing them as sharp, dangerous weapons. Some may even see it as a massive enemy to gentle creatures. These unique perspectives can be more poetically intriguing than a common image. I, too, am familiar with exploring things from different angles, so it's not surprising.

Since the advent of the internet, everyone has their own platform. This means that unconventional images and ideas are now visible on enormous public forums. It's not just about celebrating diversity; it's also about the conflicts that arise. There are those who firmly deny views that differ from their own, leading to clashes like, "An elephant's trunk isn't a snake, that's nonsense," or "Those who don't see the danger in an elephant's tusks are fools," or "Calling an elephant massive shows ignorance of whales." These arguments often resemble street brawls that draw crowds of onlookers, gaining attention in their own right. I suppose this, too, is part of learning about "distance."
