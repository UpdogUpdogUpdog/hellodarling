The person speaking in their sleep is blissfully unaware of their own sleep-talk.  
- Shigesato Itoi

What exactly is sleep-talking, I wonder.  
I'm in Kyoto right now, and apparently, I've been sleep-talking again after quite some time.

Once, in this very place, I uttered what I consider my greatest sleep-talk achievement: "breathability." That night, I decided to pay attention to "breathability." In a way, it became a guiding principle for my life. If you asked for evidence, I'd be at a loss, but thanks to this focus on "breathability," I've had many positive experiences, I think.

So, naturally, I was curious about what this latest sleep-talk might have been. I asked a witness at the scene with some anticipation. "It was clear, and a bit lengthy," they said. So, it didn't have the punch of "breathability," I see. "Your sleep-talk is mostly about work..." they added. I can't help but feel sorry for myself. But really, what was I saying about work? "It was something about starting a new job. You talked for a while, but that's all I got." What a dull sleep-talk, but then again, it's sleep-talk, so what can you do if it's not entertaining? Still, I wish I knew the full sentence that begins with "when starting a new job." As the person who said it, I'm curious. What was my sleeping self trying to convey?

The dreams we have while sleeping often have nothing to do with what we're consciously thinking about. If someone claimed that dreams reveal our true feelings, many of us would likely be labeled criminals or lunatics. But when it comes to sleep-talk, who knows? In my case, it seems to revolve around work, and the content isn't particularly strange. So does that mean my subconscious thoughts are spilling out? It would be reassuring if there were more outlandish sleep-talk mixed in. What if, in the realm of sleep-talk, where things are assumed to be realistic, something bizarre suddenly crops up? I wouldn't be able to take responsibility or even deny it.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today.  
Come to think of it, are the people listening to my sleep-talk even awake at the time?
