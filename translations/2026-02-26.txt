Personality doesn't change, and that's okay.  
By Shigesato Itoi

・I believe it's difficult to change one's personality.  
  Reflecting on myself and others, I've come to realize that personality remains stubbornly unaltered. However, regardless of personality, our actions and attitudes can indeed change. Those who know me well are aware that I'm quite shy. I have this overwhelming sense of embarrassment. As a child, people close to me often pointed it out, but these days, it's rarely mentioned, and I don't think it's perceived that way anymore. But I know myself—I’m still just as shy. Yet, I can choose not to act on that shyness. In situations where it's okay to be shy, I can indulge it shamelessly. But in circumstances where being shy would be inappropriate, I pretend to be someone who isn't. Often, due to relationships or social responsibilities, one can't simply remain shy, so I generally adopt a demeanor that appears less shy. It's akin to changing clothes, perhaps.

  When observing dogs, their personalities differ entirely. Our previous dog, Bouillon, disliked other dogs and often became aggressive or avoided interaction. But our current dog, Buiko, loves all dogs and eagerly approaches them, wagging her tail. I wonder if humans have personality differences as stark as this. It's as unchangeable as our height or the length of our limbs. It’s okay to accept that. However, behavior and actions need not align with personality. They may not feel natural since they aren't innate, but just like changing an outfit, our actions can adapt. I've heard comedians often do this—alter their behavior as needed.

  While it's said that you shouldn't push yourself too hard, I think it's perfectly fine to change like you would change clothes.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. If I stayed perpetually shy, I wouldn't be able to write at all.
