Paul Klee Was Just Here  
Shigesato Itoi

・Back in middle school, I first encountered the painter "Paul Klee" and his works in a textbook. I immediately thought, "This is it, this is what I love." All the expressions of "how nice" that resonated within me seemed to be encapsulated in Klee's art. As I gradually grew up, I realized there were many people in the world who admired Paul Klee. When I came across Klee in a novel by Junzō Yoshiyuki, I felt a surge of pride—see, I knew he was special. Among numerous painters and illustrators, I often found myself thinking, "I bet they love Klee too." 

Then, much later as an adult, I encountered Paul Klee again, this time through Shuntarō Tanikawa, who holds him in special regard. During my youth, I thought, "How nice, I really like this," but then I forgot about Klee completely. It’s somewhat akin to how I was once obsessed with the baseball player Shigeo Nagashima, only to gradually drift away. There must have been Klee exhibitions in Japan, yet I nonchalantly missed them, thinking, "Oh yeah, I once thought he was nice." Did I not like him that much, or was I simply uninterested? 

A few years ago, I met "Sylvie Vartan," and it left me with such a curious feeling—I’m not sure if it’s the same thing. Though these are my own feelings, I don't quite understand them. Besides, I never think about Klee in my daily life.

As I mused over all this, my curiosity was strangely piqued. When was the last time there was a Klee exhibition in Japan? Upon investigating, I discovered it ended just over a month ago, on August 3rd at the Shizuoka City Museum of Art. He was there just a short while ago. As if to justify myself, I ordered a book on Klee. Starting this now, at this stage, feels a bit embarrassing. "Life is short, but art is long," as they say.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. It's always better to lean in just a little.
