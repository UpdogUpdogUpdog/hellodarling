A Burn on My Fingertip: A Brief Account  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Let me share a small story, as tiny as the tip of a finger.

Last Friday night, I was at a retreat-style meeting in Akagi. After dinner, we decided to have a light barbecue. These days, camping gear has become quite advanced, and there's something called a "campfire stove." In the past, building a campfire required a certain level of skill, but with this device, anyone can get a roaring fire going without much effort. We toasted corn and grilled rice cakes, savoring the charred and delicious flavors. It was a playful, post-dinner activity—grilling and enjoying our food.

When it came time to clean up, we gathered the tongs and grill grates in one place. At that moment, a thought struck me. There was a fierce fire burning inside the campfire stove, but I wondered, just how hot is the outside of this high-performance stove? Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to lightly touch it with my fingertip... or so I thought. Instantly, I recoiled with a loud "Ow!!!" Perhaps I had an image in my mind of an insulated pot, expecting the outside not to be very hot. But it was hot. I immediately cooled my finger with ice and kept my middle finger submerged in ice water throughout the rest of the meeting. It wasn't just heat anymore; it was pain. I took some Loxonin that I always carry with me to deal with it, and I applied Lindelon's Vs cream.

In conclusion, keeping my finger in ice water for an hour turned out to be the best possible treatment. The pain subsided, the large blister gradually flattened, and now the tip of my middle finger is as tough as a guitarist's.

Reflecting quietly now, I wonder about this: Why did I let my fingertip, a part of my own body, touch something whose temperature I wasn't sure of, without thinking? Are our fingertips slightly foreign to us, in a way?

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nichi” today. This was a very small story, but I'm doing well.
