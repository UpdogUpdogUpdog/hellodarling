Every feeling is unrequited love.  
Shigesato Itoi

・There's something inherently uncomfortable about "unrequited love." I'm not sure exactly when, but back in the day, everyone seemed to be caught up in it. Remember when someone would tease you, "Hey, you like that person, don't you?" and you'd deny it with a "No way!" even though you really did? There was always a hint of resignation mixed in, acknowledging that things might not work out in the end. That lukewarm feeling was everywhere. After all, for every school sweetheart, there were countless unrequited admirers. It's not just a joke—these feelings were genuine, albeit a bit hesitant. I think that kind of unrequited love is very natural and healthy.

In fact, all feelings are unrequited love. Sometimes it might seem like mutual love, but that's just two unrequited loves happening to connect. That's why it's a bit worrisome. You might not notice someone's unrequited love for you, or your own might quietly fade away. There's a lot of vagueness in this realm.

Unrequited love is inherently selfish. Even if it's not reciprocated or goes unnoticed, you shouldn't get angry—that's just good manners. The ideal of "love" is to wish for the other person's happiness. Still, some people get so caught up in the selfish pursuit of their feelings that they become obsessed, turning into troublesome stalkers. This might have tarnished the image of unrequited love. Young people might even try to avoid it altogether. What a shame! I'm sure Goethe would agree. He was not only a great literary figure but also a master of unrequited love. I'm certainly no Goethe, but I do wish for the joyful revival of unrequited love. I hope we sing more of those songs about unrequited love and celebrate those delightful encounters between two unrequited loves.

Right now, my greatest unrequited love is directed towards my granddaughter.
