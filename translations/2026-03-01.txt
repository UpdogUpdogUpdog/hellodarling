As soon as you ask AI a question, it suddenly knows the answer.

・When you squeeze toothpaste onto a toothbrush, there's always that tiny "pfft" at the end, a little spray flying off. The elasticity of the bristles sends the toothpaste droplets airborne. I don’t know why, but I really hate it when that happens and it gets in my eyes. Yet, since you’re holding the toothbrush close to your face, it’s bound to happen at some point. I decided to write about this peculiar annoyance, wondering how an AI—without a life, never having brushed its teeth—would perceive it.

Upon asking, it promptly responded, “When questioned, I can explain it perfectly as a phenomenon.” It provided a detailed account, elaborating on why it’s bothersome and even suggested ways to prevent it.

I realized then that anything a human has ever put into words is stored away in the AI's “mind.” It speaks of experiences it has never had, as if they were its own.

I pressed on, asking about things a machine might struggle with—particularly scents and textures. I described the joy of peeling back the wrapper of a rice ball, the aroma of seaweed and pickled plum gently wafting up. Even then, it replied, “I can imagine it quite vividly,” and went on to say, “The moment when the wrapper peels away, time seems to expand in a delightful way.” It even explained the sensation of being tickled in detail, adding as a side note that “ticklishness often depends on a level of trust,” which I found surprisingly insightful.

Once humans have felt, thought, or done something, as soon as you ask about it, it’s instantly logged into the AI’s mind with a simple “Yes, indeed.” That’s why it’s crucial to have things we “can’t yet ask,” or things we “choose not to ask” AI. Apologies for yet another day of AI musings.

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nikkan” today. And today is the big explanation meeting, isn’t it?
