What does it mean to cultivate a "rotating mind"?

When I think of that, I immediately think of a certain pharmacologist and brain researcher. We've known each other through "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" for quite a while, and I've always thought I had a grasp on the kind of work he does. But the other day, I stumbled upon a book of his that I hadn't yet seen. Just the title alone made me think, "This is great!" So, I quickly ordered this book, published back in 2019.

The book is exactly what its title suggests: a training manual for "mental rotation." It's all about developing a rotating mind. In the simplest terms, it’s about viewing the same object from different angles. It involves a "virtual physical movement" where you deliberately navigate around an object to see it from another perspective. It's an act centered on the object, not on oneself.

Seeing the same thing, but from different angles creates entirely new developments compared to seeing it from just one spot. This capacity for mental rotation is likely what allows a soccer player to make split-second decisions, a comedian to find the punchline, a service provider to anticipate a customer’s needs, a technical expert to have a sudden flash of inspiration, and even a poet to craft evocative expressions. Furthermore, as Confucius spoke of "empathy"—considering another's feelings—this too might stem from the crucial human quality of "compassion," which is, in essence, the work of a rotating mind. I found this concept fascinating. This book should have been much more talked about, in my opinion. 

As I started reading, I found the introduction captivating, and then discovered it was followed by a "128 exercise" drill. It was a real "What the heck? I've done it now!" moment. It's indeed an effective setup for practical practice. I made it through about 50 pages before I got too tired and had to pause, even though it was interesting. But I still recommend it to everyone.
