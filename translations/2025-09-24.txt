"The Daily Deadline"

By Shigesato Itoi

Here I am, claiming to run an "almost daily" column, and yet, for over 27 years, I've been writing something here every single day. Some people find this astonishing, while others seem impressed, but honestly, I've never really thought it was worth boasting about. Sure, I bring it up now and then for conversation's sake, but just like anyone else, I find it a bit of a hassle. On those nights or early mornings when I'm sleepy or tired, having yet another writing task can be quite a challenge, no matter how accustomed I am to it. Yet, even though I've panicked countless times after realizing I forgot to send off a draft I'd managed to write by dawn, I've never once gone to sleep without writing at all.

How can I explain this? The key point is that I'm not doing anything impossible. What the athletes at the World Championships do is something I could never achieve, but writing something—anything—every day is, well, if I may say so, something anyone can do. If we're not judging the quality of what's written, then it's certainly not impossible. And I've come to realize that this is an incredible opportunity for me.

I have a reason to specifically call it an incredible opportunity. It's because I have a "daily deadline." Having a deadline every day for over 27 years might sound like a nightmare, but it's precisely because of this that I keep "thinking and writing." If I got caught up in debating the quality of my work, I'd never be able to write. However, when it comes to just writing "something," the act of always finding that "something" becomes a "chance" and "practice" for the writer. Without a deadline, there would be no need to find that "something." Without a deadline, one could wander endlessly, unable to write until it turned out perfect.

I've spent my days thinking of "something" to meet the daily deadline and somehow writing about it. Had I not done this, perhaps I might have become a rare but exquisite writer... though that's unlikely.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. How about considering it your "daily deadline"?
