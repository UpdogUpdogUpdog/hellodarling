Conversation is delightful simply because it is conversation.

・Take, for example, a family road trip. The father, who's quite impatient, insists on heading back the moment they reach their destination. "Alright, let's go home," he'd say with enthusiasm. This story was shared with me as a childhood memory by an acquaintance. In his mind, the father had fulfilled his duty. He drove, he reached the desired location, and that was enough. He did his part as a father.

This tale was shared with a hint of humor, but when it comes to enjoying a journey with loved ones, reaching the destination isn't really the point. The true pleasure lies in the journey itself, in the time spent traveling and experiencing together. Yet, there are people who just don't grasp this concept.

Lately, I've been contemplating that conversations between people are quite similar. They should feel like journeys we embark on together. Naturally, it's helpful if we're heading in roughly the same direction. But it's also wonderful to take detours, pause to admire the scenery, or even forget where we were headed and start something entirely new. Discovering the unexpected, seeing a different side of your companion—if those moments spent in conversation feel like playful exploration, that's the ultimate joy. Conversation should be enjoyable in and of itself, and what outcomes it yields are secondary. After all, it's not as if we're engaged in political negotiations or business deals.

Reflecting on this, I've realized there are conversations that, despite being "substantive" and "interesting," don't leave me feeling particularly joyful. This usually happens when there are no detours, no wandering off the path. It's almost as if being too orderly stifles the heart. A nonsensical metaphor can be a treat, and a wildly unrelated story that makes you want to burst into laughter is always welcome. When there's a sense of "I'm having fun talking right now," I believe it naturally leads to those delightful detours and wanderings. Of course, I apologize to those who find such diversions bothersome.
