An Epiphany While Diligently Washing My Hands  
by Shigesato Itoi

There's a wildly popular app that some are unaware of, while others know it well. It's a space for families and close friends, intended to be enjoyed in intimate circles, and it's essentially a child's growth album in digital form. Thanks to this app, both my boss and I can share in the day-to-day life of my granddaughter. From her early days of spilling baby food, to learning to walk, to her first words, trips to various places, playing in the park with friends—these photos and videos keep us connected, even if we don't see each other often.

With influenza making the rounds, I, too, stress the importance of handwashing. Lately, my handwashing has reached an impressive level of meticulousness. Upon reflection, I've realized this is because of a video on the app where she gives an adorably thorough "how to wash your hands" tutorial. My granddaughter has taken on the role of a "pretend YouTuber." She's not broadcasting to the world, but she's running her own "channel" for the family. And I've become one of her influenced subscribers.

Once upon a time, there was something called "multi-generational housing." Now, with this "family album" app, memories across two or three generations are shared seamlessly. Because of this, when we meet in person, conversations about our interests and passions flow naturally, deepening our connection. While the internet and social media have their share of "problematic aspects," there are undoubtedly many advantages. Someday, when the children grow up, they'll understand just how cherished they were by their parents and how many people watched over them. And perhaps this will even resonate with their future partners. I find myself grateful to Mr. Kasahara for creating such a wonderful tool.

I hope "Hobonichi" can evoke similar feelings. I'll continue doing my best, washing my hands diligently—after all, it's December.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. Instead of just criticizing the present times, let's also seek out its positives.
