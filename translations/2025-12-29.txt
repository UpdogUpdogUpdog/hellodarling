Napolitan is a Specialty of Naples  
Shigesato Itoi

・There's something quite nostalgic about the Showa-era "kissaten Napolitan" that's making a quirky comeback. The vibrant red of ketchup, combined with onions, bell peppers, and sausages (or sometimes bacon), and noodles that are never too firm—more on the soft side, really. They call it Napolitan, but it seems like it has absolutely nothing to do with Italy's Naples. 

A quick search will reveal the truth that there's no connection to Naples and how Napolitan came to be in Japan, along with a treasure trove of intriguing tidbits. There's a part of me that's curious, a part that wants to flaunt newfound knowledge. And then, in similar cases, I wonder if people in Tianjin actually eat "Tianjin rice," or how Frankfurt and Vienna sausages are regarded in their respective locales. It's not that I don't want to know—it's just, if I wanted to, I could find out in a heartbeat.

But isn't there something appealing about leaving things as they are? When it comes to Napolitan, Tianjin rice, Frankfurt, and Vienna sausages, keeping a "just a bit curious" attitude and skimming the surface of knowledge might be more enjoyable—like a leisurely tourist—than ruthlessly uncovering every fact through research. There are certainly things I genuinely want to know, things I'm eager to learn all about. But when it comes to something like "Napolitan," maybe it's okay to leave it be.

It's kind of like the saying, "Home is a place you think of from afar, and sing of with melancholy." You can get closer if you want, and answers will come if you seek them, but sometimes it's more fun to enjoy things in a carefree, half-hearted way. If there's anyone reading this, feeling impatient and tempted to enlighten me about Napolitan, I apologize, but I'm perfectly happy as I am.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shimbun" today. Has it made you crave a little Napolitan, perhaps?
