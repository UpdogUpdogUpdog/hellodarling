Don't Look Down on Others  
Shigesato Itoi

・No matter how right your ideas may be,  
  no matter how noble your purpose,  
  you must never look down on people  
  who are doing their best without bothering anyone.

  Every day, they eat, drink water,  
  get their teeth brushed a little,  
  shuffle their feet to make a bed, and sleep.  
  We love that dog.

  With a backpack on, heading to school,  
  listening to teachers, sometimes seriously, sometimes bored,  
  eating lunch, playing,  
  and coming back home—  
  we absolutely adore those elementary school kids.

  Laughing at something, crying over something,  
  sometimes getting angry, supporting something,  
  or quietly working diligently—  
  we help each other with those companions.

  Parents who have grown old, with more wrinkles,  
  complaining about aches and itches,  
  not as charming or stylish as they once were—  
  sometimes they remind us of ourselves.

  Whether someone is something or nothing,  
  whether they're good at their job or not,  
  whether they're deep thinkers or daydreamers,  
  there's no reason for anyone to have a say in that.

  Everyone on the train,  
  everyone waiting at the traffic light,  
  even those who dislike me—  
  you must never look down on them.

  It's not about forcing yourself to like them,  
  but first and foremost, don't look down on them.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today.  
Even if respect or admiration is too much to ask, don't look down on others.
