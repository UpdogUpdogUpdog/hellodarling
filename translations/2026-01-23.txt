Let me ponder this phrase a bit more.

Most kids, without being taught by anyone, have probably said this line at least once: "I didn't do anything wrong." They say it when they're caught in a fight or when they've accidentally broken something. And almost without fail, the adult present will respond, "You can't say you did nothing and expect us to believe that something happened on its own, can you?" From an adult's perspective, there must be a cause for whatever mischief occurred. Surely, the child must have "done something." The adults think either the child is hiding that "something" or they're unaware of what they did. This adult way of thinking isn't entirely wrong. There are times when kids lie to cover up their actions or genuinely don't realize what caused the situation.

I, too, was once part of these exchanges, getting scolded or advised. I suspect most people have been through this. It's one of those things you forget about, thinking, "Well, that's just how it is." "I didn't do anything wrong." It's a fascinating line, isn't it? It made me think a bit more deeply about it.

Sometimes, you really haven't "done anything." Not just in clear-cut cases like fights or breaking things. Sometimes, even when you've done nothing, bad things still happen. It's not always a case of someone doing something wrong and facing the consequences, as the saying "You reap what you sow" implies. As adults, even more than when we were kids, we experience this in abundance. In a dramatic line, it might be, "What did I ever do to deserve this?"—truly, nothing at all. There are situations where assigning blame or finding a cause is impossible, and this applies to both adults and kids.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. It's a cold day, snow piling up, the wind howling. And yet, I didn't do anything.
