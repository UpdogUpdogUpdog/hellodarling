There's this feeling that's hard to put into words.

When you're driving, your foot rests on the gas pedal, and even though the car is moving, you're not pressing down at all. It's not just that you're not pressing it; you're fully prepared to press it, yet you don't. Sorry for suddenly bringing up something so abstract. But maybe those who drive will get what I mean, and that's enough for me. Yesterday, I realized how crucial it is to have the "intention" to press the pedal.

When someone's about to speak, there's a moment right before they say anything, where you can sense they're about to. Sure, people often blurt things out suddenly, but when someone gives off the vibe that they're about to say something, it makes communication so much better. It's a bit more obvious with someone who's about to get angry. If you can tell they have the "intention" to get angry, it's actually kind of nice for the person on the receiving end—they can make a run for it.

The neutral state, mechanically speaking, is a "blank slate of no choices," but when humans are involved, it becomes a "prelude to the next state." It's a blank that's not really blank, filled with intention. Take Shohei Ohtani at bat, for instance. When he's just standing there, in terms of mechanics, he's in "neutral." But he's ready to flip the switch. He's got the "intention" to swing, even though he's standing still. Depending on what kind of "next state" you envision, the nature of being in neutral changes, at least that's what I think.

On another note, you know those electric shiatsu machines? They either press or stop, nothing in between. Human shiatsu, I believe, is like pressing with the "intention" to pull back. But I could go on forever, so I'll stop here.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. It would be wonderful if "intention" could be linked to "hope."
