Gentle, Strong, and Thoughtful of Others  
by Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»Shohei Ohtani and his fellow Japanese players on the Dodgers are making ripples in the hearts of Americans. I can't help but feel this way. Ohtani's humble and courteous demeanor has often been highlighted in American media. "Behaving as if you are less than your worth," perhaps that's what humility is (though, given his superhuman feats, he can't exactly hide in shyness and instead openly celebrates as a proud team member).

Reports abound, along with specific anecdotes, about how Shohei Ohtani shows concern for others in situations where one would typically express anger, or how he consistently displays respect towards the sport of baseball and all players and staff involved. In the elite world of MLB, I always thought the display of combativeness and showcasing one's strength was favored. Yet, Ohtani's humble and gentle spirit and demeanor have been met with positive feelings.

I believe this phenomenon is an "export content" that rivals the "Japanese culture" of anime and characters currently captivating the world. People are appreciating the attitude and spirit of Shohei Ohtani and the Japanese pitchers now with the Dodgers, thinking, "That mindset and spirit are admirable!" The "heart" nurtured by these athletes in Japan resonates not as some "Japanese mystery" but as something relatable. While the "heart" can't be quantified in monetary terms, it creates immense value as something truly "good."

"Humility and courtesy, sometimes even self-sacrifice" likely aligns with global sportsmanship.

Once, American fans shared something about their games with me: "In America, too, there are those who empathize with the courage of ordinary boys and girls, not just the strong heroes." Well, of course, Shohei Ohtani and his teammates are strong, no doubt.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Perhaps it's about being "gentle, strong, and thoughtful of others."
