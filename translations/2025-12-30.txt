Amazing, Isn't It the Same Every Year  
Shigesato Itoi

・Here we are again, fully immersed in the "familiar year-end and New Year." It's quite something, repeating the same routine. On the 29th, we hop on the bullet train to Kyoto. Five of us pile into a rental car and head to a hot spring inn nestled in the mountains. One member of our group has been joining us for years; there was a time when a stroller was a necessity. Now, they're shampooing their own hair in the hot springs and endlessly performing impressions, quizzes, and wild antics.

On the 30th, we take part in the usual "mochi pounding," indulging in various ways to enjoy the fresh mochi. When we return to Tokyo, the "Tanba black beans" have arrived, so we begin preparing them for cooking that night. This has been a tradition for about 30 years now. At the same time, we receive some azuki beans, which I turn into sweet red bean paste. Although I'm really not great with routines and procedures, I don’t mind tasks like this that require patience and result in something satisfying. I've even bought jars for homemade jam to send out to a few households. However, they never make it in time for the New Year’s feast. We include an animal figurine from the Iura Doll Shop near Rakushisha in Kyoto, but the packages only go out after the New Year has begun. Writing this, I realize all the “nouns” and “verbs” that crop up are so familiar. If I wrote more specifically, it would become even clearer. The same things, the same people, the same actions repeat themselves at this time of year in exactly the same way. It's not déjà vu; we know we're doing this. If I were to start describing New Year’s itself, it would undoubtedly be more of the same. At most, there might be minor changes, like the chef who prepared the New Year’s dishes having passed away or their shop closing.

Same, same, same. This sameness, in its way, has gradually evolved into the sameness it is now. There was a time when New Year's meant a trip to Bali, and there used to be a hometown to return to. If around this time next year it's the same again, maybe I'll just copy and paste this essay.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. I've come to appreciate this sameness as something to be grateful for.
