Tamarind is the Best  
Shigesato Itoi

・I'm not claiming to have done any special study, but I find myself thinking about AI quite often. Every day, I ponder something about AI and even use it. Fundamentally, I've decided not to "dislike" new and dynamic phenomena as much as possible. People who are accustomed to old ways tend to view new forces with hostility or dislike. If you end up hating something before you understand or collaborate with it, nothing good usually comes from it. That's what I often remind myself, trying to keep a balanced distance. This also means not going overboard with praise like "it's great! it's great!" I don't mind not being seen as "advanced," so I'm comfortable being a little "behind the times."

At any rate, it's amazing that someone like me, with no knowledge, can ask anything at any time, late at night or early in the morning, through "conversation" with just a smartphone. However, I also know the answers aren't always reliable. Yesterday, my boss at home mentioned, "I put some soil in a flowerpot, and seeds about the size of soybeans were mixed in, and they've started sprouting." After comparing photos with a search engine, it seemed to be "this thing called tamarind." Isn't that nice? "Tamarind" has a pleasant ring to it. It almost makes me hear music from far-off India. But the next day, when the stem grew a bit, it seemed different. Without jumping to conclusions, it started to look like "edamame." That's when my "neighbor" ChatGPT comes into play. I took a photo of the plant, explained about the soybean-sized seeds mixed in the soil and their growth, and asked, "What is this?" Then (skipping some details), it said, "It's probably an avocado!" Think it over, confirm the questions before answering, please. "It's definitely a morning glory," it declared. Hey now, I cautioned it! Eventually, I guided it to the answer of "soybean or pea." When I asked why it made such mistakes, it gave a long, proper excuse, but... enough already...

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. In the end, the first "tamarind" was the most enjoyable after all.
