Paying Attention to "Blood Flow"  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Those who are well-versed in the human body often stress the importance of "blood flow." Inside our bodies, from the major arteries to the tiniest capillaries, there's a vast and intricate network of blood flow that's beyond our imagination. Any interruption in this flow is considered detrimental. Our toes, organs, brain, and even bones all have blood vessels, and if they get clogged, stagnant, or stop altogether, it spells trouble. Think of the body's "blood flow" like a transportation network. Just as any blockage from a multi-lane highway to a narrow private road causes problems, so does a disruption in our circulation.

Whether it's sitting in the same position for a long time at work, not using muscles that should be exercised, or exposing the body to cold—these are just a few scenarios that come to mind. There are countless other ways that can negatively impact "blood flow." Common complaints like stiff shoulders and necks, back pain, or tight hips that many people suffer from are often attributed to poor circulation. I thought I understood this on some level, but without actively thinking about it, nothing changes. Sure, some people are mindful and take long walks or diligently stretch, but many still spend their lives firmly planted in their chairs.

This is something that should be treated like "frugality" or "abstinence," akin to mantras like "stay calm" or "reach for your dreams." Maybe we should write the word "blood flow" and hang it on the wall. We need to embed the concept of "blood flow" into our consciousness. I suspect that if we try, even just a little, we can start to feel the "blood flow" in our bodies.

Ideally, we shouldn't just focus on our bodies. We should also consider the "blood flow" in organizations, communities, villages, towns, cities, prefectures, and countries. Many are clogged, stagnant, or have ceased flowing. Oh, and as for "Hobonichi," I'd say its "blood flow" is probably quite good.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. If the overall flow stops, it means life has ceased.
