Being Human??

By Shigesato Itoi

There was once a commercial jingle that went, "I just want to be human." It was a television ad from a long time ago, back in 1961. The copywriter was none other than the writer Ken Kaikō. The scene involved sipping whiskey and saying, "I just want to be human." While singing, the Latin music singer Ai George danced lightly and effortlessly. The 1960s were indeed a time of rapid economic growth in Japan. Even then, the sentiment of "I just want to be human" resonated with many. If you think about it, throughout history, in any era, people have always longed to "just be human."

Yet here we are in 2025, and I find myself deeply contemplating the desire to "just be human." To be honest, "I want to be human" isn't something easily explained. There are plenty of admirable things humans do. But there's also a wealth of sorrowful actions we take. There are good, human-like people everywhere. Yet isn't doing bad things also part of being "human"? Stories throughout time have shown us that the essence of "being human" includes not just the good, but also the sly and the dirty. Humans who strive to only do "good things" have sometimes taken the lives of other "humans" in the pursuit of those very ideals.

The scope of what "being human" means is vast, almost overwhelmingly rich. Whatever spills out from the constantly-on television is all "human" communication and action. It's "human" to dismiss something as "utter nonsense," and it's "human" to scream "let it all be destroyed!" It’s all part of the package that we accept before we sing or dance about wanting to "be human." Maybe having a sip of whiskey is one way to embrace this, or perhaps gazing at the profile of someone you love is another.

Perhaps even generative AI, in its own way, wonders like a glitch during its work, "I just want to be human."

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. It was a symbol of being human, wasn't it?
