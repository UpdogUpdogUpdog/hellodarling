Here is the translation:

There are many things I think about. 
Hiroshi Itoi

I'm thinking about this and that, whatever.
I have many things to think about, 
and I'm also learning many new things.
I even think about things I can't do anything about.
I think about things that can't be helped, no matter how much I think.
There are many things I learn each day, wondering what's the point.
But I'll never stop thinking, 
nor will I stop learning, 
and I'll keep moving forward.
Sometimes I take small steps, 
and sometimes I move without knowing why.
Not stopping this process is what living is all about for me.
I'm grateful that I can do this.
It's a wonderful thing.
I'm also grateful for the people who think, learn, and move with me.
After 27 years of doing "Almost Daily," 
I look back and am amazed at how I've been able to do it.
But it's because there have been people who supported me all along.
Every day, after writing something, 
I say "Thank you for coming today" as a usual phrase.
But I really mean it from the bottom of my heart.
I may move around, decrease or increase, 
but if I can make you enjoy it, I'm happy.
Thank you for coming to "Almost Daily" today.
I've written a strange greeting for the new year here as well. Please take care.
