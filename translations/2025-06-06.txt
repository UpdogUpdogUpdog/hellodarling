There are so many things on my mind.  
Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»I'm constantly thinking about this and that.  
  There are countless things I'm pondering,  
  and even now, I'm still learning so much.

  I'm aware that some thoughts are futile.  
  There are things I consider that lead nowhere.  
  Many things I'm learning now may serve no purpose.

  Yet, I doubt I'll ever stop having thoughts.  
  I'll never cease to ponder,  
  and I can't help but feel the urge to learn.

  And so, inevitably, I take action.  
  Sometimes I move just a little,  
  and other times, I act without any clear understanding.

  This refusal to stop is, in essence, my way of living.  
  I'm grateful that I can continue this journey.

  It's a profound blessing.  
  To have people who think, ponder, learn,  
  and move alongside me.

  Looking back on 27 years of "Hobo Nikkan,"  
  I find myself amazed at how far we've come.

  But, truly, it's because  
  there were always people supporting me,  
  enabling me to keep going.

  Every day, after writing something here,  
  I express my gratitude with the familiar phrase,  
  "Thank you for visiting today,"  
  and I genuinely mean it.  
  I wander here and there, adding and subtracting,  
  and if you find any amusement in accompanying me, I'm delighted.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
Once again, I've penned an odd greeting here this year. I hope you'll welcome it as well.
