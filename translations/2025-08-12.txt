The Delight of Half a Peach  
by Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»In this season, let's say, for example, a peach.  
You eat about half of one, don't you?  
It's delicious, sweet, with a lovely aroma and texture.  
But you don't say, "Wow, I ate half a peach! How luxurious!"  
It just ends with, "That was tasty."  
Yet, if you take that half-peach and cut it nicely,  
place it on or beside a shortcake,  
everyone exclaims with delight, "Wow, it's pure peach! So extravagant!"  
The response to just "half a peach" is completely different  
from the one placed atop a cake.

The same goes for melons.  
A muskmelon is delicious and surely well-received.  
But even a thin slice, hardly more than a sliver,  
when on a cake, becomes "Wow, so much melon!"  
The same is true for strawberries, chestnuts, all of them.

This "wonderful thing" (the peach, for instance),  
shines so much brighter when it collaborates  
with someone else (like cake and cream),  
than when it stands alone.  
Of course, a peach or melon can be praised on its own,  
but it's when they join forces with others that they truly move us.

The peach empowers the sponge cake,  
and the cake makes the peach shine.  
I seem to like these kinds of relationships.  
It's much like a comedy duo, really.  
The "seemingly plain" one allows the "flashy" one to shine even more.  
It's not about which is better, funnier, or tastier.  
It's not a competition.  
The act of "creating together" multiplies the value.  
Whether it's two, three, four, eleven, or fifteen people,  
it's far more interesting than a single protagonist.

You might be a peach, or perhaps a melon, but...
