Know Your Place, Brain

・Ever since people like Takeshi Yoro wrote about "The Theory of the Brain Only," it's been said that the brain, which originally served as a kind of traffic control for our nervous system, has gotten a bit too big for its britches. Sure, it's an important job, and I appreciate what it does, but hasn't it gotten a little too full of itself? As the brain keeps evolving, tools like language and abstraction have emerged, giving it a real boost. These handy weapons have allowed the brain to develop at an accelerated pace.  

Meanwhile, the other organs, lacking such convenient tools, remain much the same as they always have been: the heart is still just a heart, arms and legs are still just limbs, eyes and noses are just what they are—almost unchanged from ancient times. And so, the brain reigns supreme. While it should be working for the whole body, for all of me, it tends to prioritize its own survival. And why not? It's easier and more efficient that way. The brain keeps thinking and doing things just to further its own development, leaving the rest of the body behind.  

Since the advent of computers, it's become an alliance between our "natural brain" and an "artificial brain." In doing so, it seems to have forgotten to make life easier and more joyful for the human body it's supposed to serve. Occasionally, the body tries to fight back through illness or muscle training, but let's face it, it can't win. If the brain stops, the whole body stops. Deep down, I think the body senses this too, feeling, "We're not just slaves to the brain."  

Yesterday, my brain pondered this: Could it be that "what doesn't really matter" is the essence of the vast universe? And similarly, could "just existing" be my true essence? I wish the brain would recognize its place and work more for the good of my entire self.  

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. Sometimes, I just want to write about things that might not resonate with anyone.
