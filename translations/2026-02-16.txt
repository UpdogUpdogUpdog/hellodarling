I went to see a baby monkey named Punch.

The little monkey I visited is a six-month-old male Japanese macaque. His name, Punch, suggests a bit of a fighting spirit. Born last summer, he was abandoned by his parents and has been raised by zookeepers through artificial feeding. He's been practicing socialization to slowly reintegrate into the troop, and officially joined the rest of the monkeys on Monkey Mountain on January 19th. While there may have been similar cases in the past, Punch's story stands out for a particular reason.

Since his time in artificial care, Punch has been accompanied by a plush orangutan, a sort of surrogate mother figure, as he joined the troop on Monkey Mountain. The plush doesn't move—it's not a robot. Yet, Punch holds its hand, leading it around as if guiding his own mother. Despite its inanimate nature, Punch clings to it, seeking comfort, cuddling up to sleep. Although he hasn't fully integrated with the troop, he's gradually learning to play and interact with them. The sight of this little monkey with his stuffed companion has touched visitors, leading someone to post a photo of the "baby monkey with an orangutan" on social media, sparking a wave of interest. 

The journey of this baby monkey, who began life with artificial care and courageously stepped into the social world of his peers, seems to have resonated as a symbol of hope for many. The hashtag supporting Punch spread rapidly, and he's swiftly becoming a beloved figure nationwide. On the Sunday I visited, as a fellow fan of Punch, the zoo experienced an "unprecedented crowd." Countless families traveled to the outskirts of Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture. It's been just a half-year journey since his birth on July 26th.

When little Punch grows up, eventually parting with his plush mother and blending seamlessly into the monkey troop, that will likely be the story's happy ending. But for now, it seems this tale of the baby monkey will continue a bit longer.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. It seems everyone is searching for their own "little story of hope."
