On Making It Through Each Day

・Alright, let's start writing without overthinking anything.  
It seems there are people who scold others for catching a cold, saying it's a sign of poor self-management. This kind of reprimand has led some people to preemptively apologize when they catch a cold themselves, saying, "I'm sorry for not managing myself better."

If self-management could really prevent colds, I'd do it too! Please, tell me how to manage myself to avoid catching a cold, and I'll follow it to the letter. I've had plenty of practice with handwashing, gargling, and wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, so I can do it if I need to. Now that I think about it, I felt surprisingly well during that time. Handwashing and gargling must indeed be part of "self-management," surely.

But enough about colds. Let's talk about rice balls. Yes, rice balls—it's all about the rice you shape. At some point, my rice balls became soft and fluffy. It was after I learned to "shape them as gently as possible." For a gentle shape, it's best if the rice is hot. Freshly cooked rice, so hot it almost burns your hands, has a higher synergy grain by grain, making it easier to mold. Later, I found out that warm rice works fine even if it isn't scorching hot. Still, "gently and lightly shaping" is ideal. For a long time, I've been making soft rice balls.

However, I recently realized something. My boss's rice balls are way cooler. My fluffy rice balls seem to fall short somehow. Apparently, they also "shape them lightly." The mystery remained unsolved for a while, but I figured it out the other day. I had been overemphasizing "gently and lightly," shaping them too much with that focus. Amateurs and know-it-alls tend to overemphasize things. After that, I started shaping them with a lighter touch.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. In any case, if you just start writing, things will work out somehow. No one's grading you, after all.
