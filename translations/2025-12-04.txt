Meeting No One I Dislike  
Shigesato Itoi

・There was once a film critic who published a book titled, "I’ve Never Met Anyone I Dislike." In reality, Mr. Yodogawa wasn't entirely free from encountering people he disliked. He was known to be quite a complex person, and not always the gentle, easygoing fellow he appeared to be. The book's title was more of a wishful thinking on his part—a way of deciding to live life with that mindset.

Just the day before yesterday, I was having a casual meal with someone who was back in Japan for the "Satogaeru Concert." We were chatting about trivial things when I mentioned, "You know, maybe the reason I manage to stay fairly upbeat is that I don’t have to meet people I dislike."

"That might be true for me too. I’m not doing anything I hate at all," they replied.

"I can see that in you, Akko-chan," I said. It struck me then how incredibly fortunate that is. Of course, it’s not that I don’t have people I dislike. And it’s not like Akiko Yano never does things she dislikes either.

But, I don’t keep meeting people I dislike out of obligation. Naturally, those relationships become distant and eventually fade away. I’ve worked hard to create a life where that’s possible. I’m not unaware of how much practice Yano has put in, and how she’s pursued her music. I understand the intensity of her experiences and thoughts.

Yet, she says, "I do it because I want to, because it’s fun," which means she isn’t doing things she dislikes. She even once told her daughter, "Isn’t everyone like that?" only to be told that’s not how the world works. It’s clear to me that not everyone is like that.

But you see, this is almost entirely a matter of "perspective." Even if you meet the same people, thinking "I only meet people I dislike" is a personal perspective. Feeling like "I spend my days doing things I hate" is also a perspective. I think there might be a way to cultivate that perspective.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. Today, I'm eagerly heading to a place where it’s said to be minus six degrees.
