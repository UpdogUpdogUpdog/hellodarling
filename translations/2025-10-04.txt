Shigesato Itoi Once Again Praises the Yuichi Inoue Exhibition  
Shigesato Itoi

・Fridays at "Hobonichi" are designated as "Independent Day."
  We don't schedule meetings; instead, each person decides for themselves what they ought to do.
  Whether it's watching a movie, binge-reading manga, or anything else.
  Even if it's just zoning out in the park, it's a personal choice.
  I tend to have interviews scheduled on Fridays, so I rarely get the chance to be truly independent.

  However, yesterday, I had no meetings or plans to meet anyone.
  Determined to make it a quintessential Friday, I headed to the Shoto Museum of Art in Shibuya.
  This exhibition.
  I had planned to visit at some point since I was somewhat involved in the project, but finally, I took the plunge.
  I thought I had been viewing Yuichi Inoue's calligraphy with great admiration,
  but seeing it now, at this point in my life, I realized it was much more incredible, leaving a deep impression on me.
  It felt as if I was watching a soul in motion, rather than just observing written works.
  On this day, I was particularly captivated by the piece known worldwide, "Gutetsu."
  In the black ink of the large "Gutetsu" calligraphy, I saw my own reflection.
  I was inside the calligraphy, and behind me, two other pieces were reflected on the wall.
  The characters were "Mother" and "Laughter."
  Of course, the exhibition wasn't designed with such an intention, but there it was, an overlapping image of "Gutetsu, Me, Mother, Laughter."
  Photography wasn't allowed, so this remains only in my memory, but it was fascinating—my own personal drama unfolding in Yuichi Inoue's world of calligraphy.

  The Shoto Museum of Art isn't crowded, and the building has a nice ambiance.
  If you have the time and opportunity, I highly recommend visiting.
  I'll likely return in the latter half of the exhibition after the display changes.
  On the way back, it's nice to walk from Shoto.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today.  
I also found traces of my work from that era within the exhibition.
