Oh, how I laughed with joy at Shinosuke in Kesennuma.  
Shigesato Itoi

・At the Kesennuma Civic Hall,  
　it's different, you know, from anywhere else.  
　I'm sure there are all sorts of reasons for it.  
　I imagine it's different in Toyama, different in Shibuya too.  
　Maybe that's just how it is, but if you're a fan of Shinosuke Tatekawa,  
　I can wholeheartedly recommend experiencing "Shinosuke in Kesennuma."  
　With seriousness, warmth, precision, and boldness,  
　you'll savor the three hours entirely, thinking,  
　"Rakugo is truly something special, and Shinosuke is amazing."  
　You know how some BBQ places offer "whole cow purchases"?  
　In Kesennuma, it's a "whole Shinosuke purchase."

As someone "chosen by rakugo,"  
　I don't know if that's fortunate or unfortunate for him,  
　but after witnessing Shinosuke in Kesennuma,  
　I felt, "Ah, it was a good thing, surely it brings him happiness too."  
　These days, many people are watching performances,  
　and there's a kind of reverence for art and expression,  
　which I think is present in rakugo as well.  
　It's certainly something found in music, in painting.  
　Art is probably something fearsome.  
　Though it might be presumptuous for a writer like me to say,  
　reaching artistic heights doesn't always require deals with demons or devils.  
　There seems to be some "affirmative something" that's neither demon nor devil,  
　that allows one to reach those heights.  
　What is that something?  
　I don't know, perhaps "a person genuinely rejoicing."  
　Or "the ripples of joy expanding in the heart of an artist."  
　I don't really know, but there is such a blissful peak.  
　I feel as though Shinosuke is gently drifting towards that happy artistic height.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today.  
A person who can give such nourishing laughter is a "national treasure" of Japan.
