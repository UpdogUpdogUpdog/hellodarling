Have You Really Asked Yourself About "Likes and Dislikes"?

By Shigesato Itoi

・There's this idea that's been gaining traction lately: "Relying on what you like or dislike can actually be more dependable than logic or profit." I find myself agreeing with this notion about half of the time. In a society that seems to worship logic and profit above all else, it's only natural to question, "Is that really so?" After all, logic and profit don't always lead to the best outcomes. Sometimes, it's better to take a loss and pursue something you love, and there are moments when you just want to dive headfirst into something that defies logic. Yet, I wonder if emphasizing likes and dislikes too strongly is really the right approach.

Imagine you like someone—not necessarily in a romantic sense, but there's someone you genuinely like. Now, ask yourself, "Is that really true?" You might push back and say, "Of course it is! I like them for no particular reason!" But hold on a moment.

When you really delve into what you like about them and why, perhaps you'll uncover some reasons. Maybe it's because they acknowledge you, or they do things that benefit you. These realizations might come into view, and there's nothing wrong with that—"because that's just the way it is!" Similarly, if you probe into your dislikes, you might find reasons like, "If they're good, then I must be bad," or "They look down on me." The point is, likes and dislikes aren't just "natural." And it's not like what's "natural" is inherently noble either.

Indeed, one's "inner forest" is dark, deep, and utterly fascinating.
