Once known as the President of Anko.  
by Shigesato Itoi

・I have a fondness for anko.  
　While you could describe it as sweetened adzuki beans,  
　"anko" is more than just boiled beans.  
　After boiling, it's heated in a tin-lined pot called a sawari,  
　allowing the moisture to evaporate as if searing it.  
　During this process, the sugar reaches a point just before caramelization,  
　creating a "light caramelization" that enhances its flavor.  
　Be careful not to burn it—just let it become a bit sticky.

　When I start talking about anko,  
　I tend to become so insistent that it might annoy the listener.  
　I understand; I know it's not good to be so dogmatic.  
　Besides, anko isn't always made from adzuki beans.  
　Various beans can be used, and they all taste great.  
　Uguisu an, shiro an, kuri an—they're all wonderful.  
　Sometimes even sweetened sekihan (sticky rice) is used as filling for manjū, and it's delicious.  
　I must admit, despite what I've said,  
　I actually don't dislike anko that's just sweetened, or zenzai, or shiruko—I quite like them.

　Throughout the country, depending on the region and the shop,  
　there are many kinds of anko, and they're generally delicious.  
　There are those I prefer and those I find nice,  
　but as long as it's not bad, it's all tasty.  
　I don't insist on this or reject that.  
　In the end, a hobby aimed at "preference" turns around and lands in the vast field of "tolerance."  
　Very rarely, I encounter something that makes me go, "Hmm..."  
　However, it's often due to the outer layer rather than the anko itself.  
　Anko, in essence, can't be made carelessly.  
　The ingredients are simply beans and sugar, but it takes time and effort.  
　If you're not up for it, you can buy from an anko vendor.  
　Professional anko factories ensure a consistent level of deliciousness.

　I love anko and I’m a staunch supporter of it.  
　Somehow, I've reached this state of "gracious acceptance."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today.  
I predict that one day it will be recognized abroad too.
