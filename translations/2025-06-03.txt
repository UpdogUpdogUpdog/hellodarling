Translation:
"So it is. It changes almost every day."
"I've already announced it, so most of you probably know. The design of the 'Hoboni' home page will change. Just the design changing is a big deal, but various other things will also change gradually. Well, even if it's mostly the same as the current 'Hoboni', it has been changing in various ways since its founding, so change is a natural element of living. This article I'm writing now has the title 'Today's Darling'. Many people may be wondering what it's about. That's because when I started 'Hoboni', I decided to refer to myself as 'Darling'. I didn't want to be called something like 'Boss', 'Lord', or 'President', so I chose 'Darling' as a way to avoid being called anything at all. It's embarrassing to call oneself 'Darling', and I'm also embarrassed to be called that, but it's a modern art-like sense I started with. Surprisingly, it has become natural to me. Today, 'Darling' is writing about something, and that's what 'Today's Darling' is. Up until now, changing things has been a hassle, so 'Today's Darling' has continued. When should I stop? The team for this 'Home Revision' has decided. For 27 years, it hasn't changed much, but even if it changes, it won't be a problem. Well, my writing style might change a bit. The title of the day will be followed by the article. Some of you may have noticed that I've been practicing writing in this format already. This is it, and if it's not convenient, I'll change it. I'll say it again, change is an essential element of living. And I'll keep writing from tomorrow onwards. Thank you for coming to 'Hoboni' today. Thank you for coming, and that part hasn't changed at all."

Footnote:
「ほぼ日」(hoboni) is a Japanese idiom that roughly translates to "almost every day" or "nearly every day".

So it is. It changes almost every day.
