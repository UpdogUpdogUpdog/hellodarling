On Catching Five Fish in Eight Hours  
by Shigesato Itoi

・It all started when T from "Hobo Nikkan" absentmindedly mentioned, "I'd like to try fishing sometime." He wondered aloud, "Is it fun? Is it interesting?" This sparked something in people with similar thoughts, including Y, who was practically itching to go fishing. Along with those who had never fished before, those eager to try anything, and even a few seasoned anglers, they decided to head to a "managed fishing area" near Tokyo. Nowadays, they call this "area fishing."

At the point of paying the fishing fee, they had to choose between a two-hour course and a five-hour course. Naturally, the newcomers thought, "We'll just do the two-hour course." But Y, with the confidence of experience, declared, "No, that won't be enough. We should go for the five-hour course." It was a decision that demonstrated his usual leadership. As expected, once they started fishing, they were hooked. They quickly finished their grilled rainbow trout lunch and couldn't wait to get back to the water. In the end, even the five-hour course wasn’t enough—they extended by another three hours, making it a total of eight hours of fishing. "Everyone stood the whole time," they said, a testament to their complete immersion. Even those who had never fished before stood the entire time. "Eight hours, huh. I get it. So, how many did you catch?" I asked, curious about their triumphs.

"Everyone caught about five each," Y replied, clearly pleased. "Oh, so everyone had a grea..." I began, when I caught the faint chuckle of K (pseudonym) nearby. I didn’t miss that. He probably thought, "Only five fish in eight hours?" I took it upon myself to set him straight. "Five fish is a joyous number!" I declared. Opinions might differ, but to those who fish, catching five is indeed a delight! I wonder if this will come up in tonight's conversation.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. I really want to go fishing. When you're fishing, you forget everything else.
