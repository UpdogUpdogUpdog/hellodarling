The real answer often lies elsewhere.  
Shigesato Itoi

In his later years, I found myself asking him all sorts of questions.  
Once, I inquired, "What sparked your deep interest in Shinran, Yoshimoto-san?"  
I half-expected him to recount some philosophical encounter or a profound experience from his youth.  
"My family hails from Nagasaki, a region deeply rooted in Jodo Shinshu Buddhism.  
I suppose that had a significant influence on me."  
Hearing this, I couldn't help but think, "Oh, really?"  
It wasn't the type of answer I had anticipated.  
Yet, over time, I realized Yoshimoto-san's response of "my family practiced Jodo Shinshu"  
was far more genuine and clear-eyed than the kind of answer I had been hoping for.  
In retrospect, it taught me something valuable.  
Come to think of it, I always did admire straightforwardness.

Questions and answers have a certain artistry to them.  
A well-crafted question can lead to remarkable discoveries,  
and a thoughtful answer can be a beautiful expression in itself.  
As a result, there's a natural tendency for people to want to ask insightful questions,  
and for those answering to provide responses that impress.  
It's common to see conversations where both parties seem to be playing catch,  
tossing around questions and answers that look clever on the surface.  
I, too, have often indulged in such games.  
But, Yoshimoto-san's response that day was truly impressive.

Since that moment, I've tried to practice "looking at things straightforwardly."  
It's about not pretending to understand when you don't.  
While it's fine to have the ambition to get closer to your ideals,  
efforts to present yourself in a certain way tend to be transparent to those with discerning eyes.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
Last night, I spent about two hours singing karaoke. It was invigorating.
