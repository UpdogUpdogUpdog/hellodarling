Moments of Inspiration, Like Puns

・The Dodgers' bench, where the players are all lined up,  
  facing the camera.  
  Shohei Ohtani is there, slightly left of center in the front row.  
  With a knowing smile, he holds a rice ball.  
  Following his lead, the players and staff on the bench  
  all raise rice balls near their faces.  
  Has anyone ever seen such a photo?  
  Probably not.  
  It's a photo that exists only in my mind—a scene I imagined.  
  Naturally, I have no idea what might have happened on the Dodgers' bench  
  or why they're holding rice balls.  
  It's just an image that popped into my head.  

  Like coming up with a clever pun,  
  when I think of an amusing "what if" photo like this,  
  I let it linger vaguely in my memory.  
  I feel like I've often done things like this.  

  It must be summer, the sky is a shade of blue that's almost too intense.  
  At the poolside, deserted except for two deck chairs—  
  one on the right and one on the left—  
  a man and a woman are lounging, each on their own chair.  
  Suddenly, the woman on the right hurls a magazine she had in hand.  
  The magazine doesn't reach the man on the opposite side, landing in the water.  
  The man pretends not to notice, keeping his eyes closed.  
  Next, the woman throws a sandal.  
  It flies with force but only splashes into the water.  
  Are they fighting? I wouldn't know.  
  It's just a scene I imagined, and I haven't thought it through.  

  I once turned this fleeting image into a short piece of writing.  
  It lingered, never forgotten, in my mind.  

  Among these whimsical images, there's one of "a baseball stadium erupting into flames and soaring into the sky."  
  That image expanded and became a song called "TOKIO."  
  As for Shohei Ohtani and his rice balls, they'll probably remain just that.
