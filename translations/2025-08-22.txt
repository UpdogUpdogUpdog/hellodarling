The Empty Hours of a Child's Summer Vacation  
Shigesato Itoi

・I was born in the post-war years, a time not particularly prosperous. Back then, there weren't many "fun" products available, and even if there were, I couldn't really afford them.

Watching children today head off on various summer adventures fills me with envy, even at this stage in my life. I find myself wishing, as an old man, that I could be a child again and play like that.

Yet, when I think back to my own childhood summers, even though they were set against the backdrop of sun, blue skies, sudden showers, and swimming pools, what I remember most vividly is the time spent staring vacantly at the sunlight or the ceiling, wondering what to do next. Of course, I had plenty of times when I was with friends, playing somewhere just right, but rarely did we engage in activities planned by adults. Oddly enough, it's the solitary hours, when friends were nowhere to be found, that linger in my memory. Bright, hot, and, yes, a bit lonely. I read comics, sometimes even books. Yet the sensation of those seemingly empty summer days is etched into my heart. If I may embellish a bit, I feel like I was raised primarily by those "nothing-to-do" hours of emptiness.

As an adult, there's always "something to do." You can manage your own money and time to some extent. In contrast, a child on summer vacation is like a dashing figure with no money or power, yet overflowing with time. Within those empty hours lay fear, loneliness, and some mysterious, essential nutrients. Being forced to sit with those feelings—unable to escape—spurred me to reflect and ponder.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. Truth is, even as adults, we still need those "empty hours," don't we?
