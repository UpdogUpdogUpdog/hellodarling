What makes a person "good"?

・Once upon a time, we put out a call for people on "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" with the theme of "good people." I was prepared for comments about how vague the topic was, but surprisingly, it wasn’t an issue at all. In fact, back in 2015, those who responded to the "good people" call are still thriving members of our team today.

We had many discussions about this recruitment approach, coming to the conclusion that those who join us and end up being appreciated as good people are the ones you want to work with. We recognized the variety of values people hold, but ultimately, what everyone desires most is to be considered a good person. So we figured, why not aim to meet people who might be described that way from the get-go? It was a sort of reverse-engineering approach.

Defining what makes someone a "good person" precisely isn't easy. Yet, identifying certain traits or qualities that are undeniably indicative of goodness is worthwhile. As we sought new crew members, we also sought to understand what embodies a good person, and I think that was a valuable endeavor. We had several keywords in mind, though articulating them too much felt risky—words like "sincerity and contribution," "kindness, strength, and humor," and "trust." Our "experiment" from a decade ago continues in various forms even today.

Recently, I came across a phrase that brought back these memories: "Do no harm knowingly." This ancient Greek wisdom from Hippocrates, later highlighted by Peter Drucker in "Management" as a "professional responsibility," resonated with me. A "good person" is someone who does not knowingly cause harm. It’s a complex idea, but it seems fitting.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Those who join us here are truly good people.
