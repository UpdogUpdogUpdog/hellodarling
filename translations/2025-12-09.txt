Last Night  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Last night, I had plans to have dinner with some young people I recently met. We arranged to meet at a yakiniku restaurant at 7 PM. We ate heartily, chatted a lot, and even had a friend who lived nearby join us midway. We ended up having a great time for over four hours. I’m the kind who eats a lot without drinking, but I felt a bit tipsy in spirit when I got into a taxi to head home. When I arrived, my boss was watching TV and simply said, "Earthquake."

"What, there was an earthquake? I didn’t notice at all since I was in a taxi," I said, noticing that the ceiling light was still swaying slightly. It seemed the earthquake in Tokyo wasn't too severe. If it had been a magnitude of 3 or higher, the dog would have barked, but it hadn’t. The TV was filled with tense reports. Every channel was broadcasting earthquake news. It implied a significantly dangerous situation. I found myself glued to the emergency news.

Gradually, the reports shifted from the earthquake to the tsunami. The announcer repeatedly urged people to flee due to the tsunami threat, almost shouting the warnings. Inevitably, the memories of March 11, 2011, came flooding back. Nobody wants to go through that again. After that disaster, everyone learned about tsunami preparedness and mental readiness. But that doesn’t mean we can resist the overwhelming force of nature.

As I kept watching, the tsunami advisory escalated into a tsunami warning, and the urgency of the "Evacuate" broadcasts intensified. It started to feel as if watching the news was somehow my responsibility. The tsunami forecast initially announced waves as high as three meters, causing further tension. I hurriedly searched for information on the tsunami heights during the Great East Japan Earthquake and found figures like seven or eight meters. It seemed this time it wouldn’t be as severe.

Eventually, reports came in that the observed tsunami was only 45 centimeters. With relief, I thought this wouldn’t turn into a disaster like 2011. (It’s now 2:40 AM) Of course, we can’t be complacent yet, but I’ve finally torn my eyes away from the TV screen to start writing this piece.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. I sincerely hope everyone in the affected areas remains safe.
