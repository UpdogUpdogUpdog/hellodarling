Another Round on Ideas  
Shigesato Itoi

In the ten thousand entries of this daily series, the topic I've undoubtedly written about most is "ideas."

Honestly, it's all about "ideas" for me. I crave them myself, and "Hobo Nikkan" could use a hundred times more "ideas" than it has now.

Nothing propels us forward like an "idea." Often, the reason we remain stuck in endless arguments is simply the lack of them. Without an "idea" saying, "Hey, why not try this?", the friction just keeps building.

People casually ask everywhere, "How do you come up with good ideas?" That kind of detached questioning already shows a disconnect from "ideas." It's you who has to come up with them. If there were some trick to it, the world would be overflowing with "ideas" by now.

When a painter chooses a color, that's an "idea." "Ideas" aren't confined to themes, compositions, or methods alone. In music, too, there's always that "aha!" moment of an "idea." Whether it's a melody, a tone, a rhythm, or a vocalization, no great expression exists without an "idea."

Occasionally, there's a moment when you can almost see an "idea" being born. Whether it's yours or someone else's, it's exhilarating. It feels like, "Yes, this will get us across the river." For instance, today, this piece has no "idea." If anything, it's a complaint about "ideas," showing I can at least fill a column with that.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. Without ideas, we can't live. Truly.
