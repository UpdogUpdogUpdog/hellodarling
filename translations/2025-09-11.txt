How do we even know what's good or bad?  
Shigesato Itoi

・Honestly, I didn’t understand a thing.  
  As a child, when adults talked about something being "good" or "bad," it made no sense to me.  
  Let me give you an example of how truly clueless I was.  
  There was a genre called rōkyoku, also known as naniwabushi.  
  Back in the 1950s, radio was the main source of entertainment.  
  It broadcast rakugo, manzai, and rōkyoku, which adults enjoyed and children, like me, ended up hearing as well.  
  Rakugo and manzai were amusing, even for kids.  
  But rōkyoku? That was something else entirely.  
  It was just these old men and women crooning in raspy voices.  
  They had this peculiar way of singing, and to my ears, it just sounded like grating, hoarse noise.  
  I couldn't fathom what was so enjoyable about it.  
  "What a great voice," Grandma would say.  
  It was a world completely beyond a child's comprehension.  
  Similarly, when people praised Misora Hibari or Koshiji Fubuki, I didn’t get it.  
  What did it even mean to sing well?  
  Everyone seemed good if they were called good, but it was baffling to me.  
  It remained a mystery throughout my childhood.

And then, somehow, things changed.  
  I don't even know when it happened, but it did.  
  Not just with music and performances, but with everything, I began to say "That's nice" or "That’s good."  
  Up until my teenage years, I still didn’t really understand.  
  Even with electric guitars, I thought fast, dynamic playing was probably good.  
  I was just pretending to know, trying to cover up my ignorance, but somewhere along the way, I started genuinely feeling, "This is nice."  
  I discovered emotions like "Wow" and "Oh."  
  Eventually, I began to sense things like "That's skillful," "That's okay," or "Is that a bit fake?"  
  It’s strange how I, who once understood nothing, now confidently judge things as "good" or "bad."  
  I wonder how AI would handle something like this.
