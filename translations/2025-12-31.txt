Everyone Starts as a Beginner

・Once you master something, you tend to forget the early days when you couldn't do it. If you can ride a bicycle now, you probably don't remember how it felt not being able to, right? It's the same for swimming or reciting the multiplication tables. When I first started fishing, I realized that as I became more experienced, I would inevitably forget my current feelings and thoughts. So, I decided to document them. This idea came to fruition when I was given a space to write a series for the magazine "Paper Wrestling," which eventually became the book "Mistaken Fishing Life." The mistakes and imaginations of a beginner, being hard to remember later, become fascinating when recorded. After all, no one is naturally skilled; everyone starts as a beginner, full of their own clumsy moments. Yet, we often end up acting all high and mighty, don't we? Well, it's common to turn beginner mistakes into anecdotes and have a good laugh about them.

This idea applies to the relationship between adults and children too. As kids, there were plenty of things we didn’t understand. Thinking you could pull the moon down from the night sky with a long stick or believing everything around you just existed naturally—most adults know these aren’t true. Even so, there are things children feel more intensely than adults. Whether it's feeling sad without being able to explain why, having likes or dislikes without knowing the reason, or feeling powerless and frustrated, or being terrified of being alone—children experience all these emotions. But as we grow up, we gradually forget about them. It might be worthwhile to occasionally recall our time as beginners in life. "Never forget your beginner's spirit" seems like advice everyone could use.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. I ended up writing about remembering things on New Year's Eve, a day for forgetting.
