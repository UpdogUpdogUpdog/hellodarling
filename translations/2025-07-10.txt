On Trivial Sorrows  
by Shigesato Itoi

・You stub your little toe somewhere, and it hurts like hell. I bet most people know this pain. Yet, despite how excruciating and tragic an accident it is, the fact that it's just a "little toe" makes it seem so insignificant that it gets laughed off in the end. Not that I'd want anyone to be overly sympathetic about it, either.

Pouring protein powder into a shaker, adding some "delicious unsweetened soy milk," and just a dash of Calpis, I shake it vigorously—only to realize I hadn't closed the lid. The concoction sprays out like a fountain, covering everything. Such frustrations, too, garner no sympathy. Perhaps because, honestly, it's a trivial matter. No one cares how much of an "unwanted hassle" it is to wipe down the entire kitchen.

Whether you see someone scatter coins all over the street, meet someone locked out of their hotel room in pajamas without a key, or witness someone carefully saving the sausage in their hot dog only to drop it at the end, or even watch as a plane you were supposed to be on takes off without you—these things are usually dismissed as amusing anecdotes, laughed off as insignificant.

For the person involved, it’s genuinely sorrowful, bewildering, a real pain, and it costs them both time and money. Yet, it's generally considered no big deal. I've endured countless minor woes and sorrows myself. If anything, I think I have more than my fair share. My greatest trait as a human being is "carelessness," after all. This has caused trouble for others and heartache for me. But, you know, if your sorrow is just something to laugh about, that's a kind of happiness. At some point, I came to see it that way. Truly sad things are the ones you don't speak of and try to forget.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Being able to say, "I was sad then," with a laugh is wonderful.
