Various Friends  
Shigesato Itoi

・I suppose this goes back to my elementary school days.  
　I've always had a mix of different kinds of friends,  
　never really fitting into any particular "group."  
　Growing up in a public elementary school in a provincial city during the Showa era,  
　all the children from the neighborhood attended the same school.  
　I don't recall there being any kids from upper-class families.  
　I don’t even know if such a class existed in Maebashi.  
　If you think of it now, it was just middle-upper, middle-middle, and middle-lower.  
　And then there were kids who had their own unique circumstances.  
　After all, I was born three years after the war ended.

　There were kids with helicopter parents, privileged kids,  
　those who would eventually go down a rebellious path, and the quiet ones.  
　Somehow, we all just got along together.  
　That same circle of friendships carried on through junior high, high school,  
　and even a bit into university.  
　I had friends who were into literature, into sports,  
　precocious ones, brainiacs, and the so-called "bad" kids.  
　Each of them had something about them that was better than me,  
　so I generally thought, "Wow, that's great," and enjoyed their company.  
　The good, the bad, the high, the low, the serious, the unserious—  
　at that age, none of it really amounted to much.

　Looking back, my friendships as an adult still feel like they did in elementary school.  
　Sometimes people ask me why I have such a diverse range of friends,  
　but honestly, I don’t really know myself.  
　Well, there’s no one I absolutely can’t associate with,  
　and I simply avoid people I dislike, so there are no issues for me.  
　Our interests and conversations may be all over the place,  
　but isn’t it more fun to encounter something different than to hear the same things over and over?  
　I find it most interesting when I can say, "Oh, really? Is that so?" again and again.

　After finishing Netflix's "Love is Blind,"  
　I found myself reminiscing about various friends.  
　Indeed, the cast was full of people I wouldn’t usually meet.
