The Perks of Being Underestimated  
by Shigesato Itoi

・When I was young and working in advertising, I remember going to client meetings and being asked, "So, where is the copywriter?" At the time, I was probably around 25 years old, and without any ill intent, they likely assumed I was just an assistant. In moments like these, I didn’t think much of it. I’d simply say, "That would be me." Some might see this as being underestimated, but I’ve spent much of my life in such a state. And honestly, I don't mind it much. In fact, I understand why people might underestimate me and have come to terms with it.

Being underestimated can actually be a bit of an advantage. When you're seen as "not much of a threat," people are less guarded around you, more likely to share their true thoughts. And when someone who’s underestimated shows even a little competence, it's often met with surprise and admiration: "Oh, you’re actually capable." It's far better than walking into a room with expectations of being "amazing."

In this sense, it might sound paradoxical, but it's more beneficial to be from a small, unknown company than from a prestigious one. A slightly awkward appearance or manner of speaking can make you more "underestimated" than someone who seems exceptionally competent. This actually helps you understand others better, and because they underestimate you, they're often more willing to teach you things carefully.

Children among adults, or even dogs and cats, all enjoy being underestimated in a good way, don't they? They are the best observers of people.

By the way, being underestimated is different from being disliked, isn't it?
