Sleeping is for the world and for myself.

・People ought to live by prioritizing what's truly important.  
  It's true, absolutely true, no doubt about it.  
  Yet, people often don't live that way.  
  Yes, yes, that's probably true, I must admit, I'm the same.

  To live prioritizing important things, you need to know what's truly important.  
  People tend to be pretty haphazard when deciding these things.

  "Study hard, play hard."  
  This is a crucial lesson for how children should live.  
  However, since kids naturally tend to play without being told,  
  the "study hard" part ends up being emphasized more.  
  So, in reality, "study hard, play hard" often becomes just "study hard."

  Similarly, we have sayings like "sleeping children grow" and "sleep is the foundation of health."  
  These are common sense.  
  But whether as children or adults, people sleep well without being nagged to do so.  
  Just like playing, sleeping comes naturally.  
  This is where tales of "sacrificing sleep for success" sneak in.  
  Stories of pulling all-nighters to finish a project,  
  or dedicating oneself to studies by cutting back on sleep,  
  or pushing through with "more important things" instead of sleeping,  
  are often glorified as impressive feats.  
  The importance of good sleep is pushed aside.  
  Sleep, which should be a priority, loses its place.

  I've come to realize again that sleep is crucial.  
  I knew it, but hadn't been prioritizing this important thing.  
  Sleep is more important than reading, dramas, and certainly more than "X."  
  Just as I schedule exercise alongside work,  
  sleep should be secured even more than important tasks.  
  I know, I know, saying it is one thing, actually doing it is another.  
  But if you seriously reassess priorities, that's how it should be.  
  I'll make it a point to sleep two extra hours from now on.

Before worrying about whether you can do it, deciding to do it is what's important.
