The Poet and Science  
Shigesato Itoi

・Last night, under the title "Last Night," I had a conversation with musician Kensaku Tanigawa and editor Keiko Kawaguchi. Our topics bounced around like a pinball. Of course, I was supposed to be the moderator, but I ended up being more of a tangent guide. Surprisingly, it was often Kensaku who steered us back on track. When I think about it, there aren't many chances to talk about how, when you open the door, you might see Tanigawa's legs sprawled out in the hallway. Or how he said it didn't hurt—these are really household stories. Shuntarō, if you were alive, you'd definitely want in on this conversation. We keep laughing, thinking, "He'd probably say this, or that..." It's delightful.

This kind of joy must stem from a unique personality. My lifelong ideal has been to be a lively presence at a wake. "He was like this, did that, such a fool," everyone would endlessly share stories. Late into the night, someone might say, "I'm going home for a bit, but I'll come back," and they actually would. A wake filled with laughter, a farewell gathering that's more of a celebration. My somewhat comical ideal seems like something Tanigawa demonstrated for me first.

Gradually, he weakened, and the bouts of illness became more frequent. Shuntarō apparently once said at home, "I might aim to become a living Buddha by not eating anything." Kensaku replied, "That's impossible and unrealistic." From a poet's perspective, the idea of becoming like a withered tree by not eating daily is something one can imagine. Eventually, the poet said, "That's not going to happen. I give up," and it didn't take long for him to reach that conclusion. This poet had a fondness for science too.

From a radio assembled by a boy who loved science, he heard human voices and music. Could such wonderful things really exist in the air? Eventually, the boy became a poet, extracting poems from the air.

Kensaku, Keiko, let's continue the wake.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. I'm heading out. To see the rakugo* and to meet everyone.
