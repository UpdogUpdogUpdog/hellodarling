Getting Along, Becoming Friends  
Shigesato Itoi

・Why does it make me so happy to see different kinds of animals getting along? A lion raised by a dog mother, a dog bringing home a fawn, a chimpanzee and a dog, a cow and a dog forming a friendship—there are lots of examples (though admittedly, they all seem to involve dogs). I've watched so many of these heartwarming scenes. It seems I'm not the only one who enjoys such interspecies connections; it resonates with many.

What is it about these scenes that we find so appealing? Is it the idea of "breaking down barriers" between species? Or maybe it's simply the joy of seeing friendship? Even I can't fully grasp this feeling, but I suspect it applies not only to animals but to people as well. It's wonderful when people of the same kind get along, but there's something particularly touching about stories of seemingly different people becoming close. Differences in race, in generations, even former enemies embracing across borders—all of these scenarios are moving.

Perhaps we wish to expand the possibilities of "getting along" even further. In today's world, the term "division" has become quite popular. Indeed, there may be many instances of "separating and opposing" happening all around us. But somewhere deep down, I believe humanity has always known that the ability to "get along" is a strength and a path to a better life. It's something innate, beyond mere reasoning. So when we see different species of animals befriending each other, it might fill us with joy because it shows us the vast possibilities. And now, I've realized something anew: humans and dogs are technically different species, aren't they?

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. People and dogs truly exemplify the best kind of interspecies friendship!
