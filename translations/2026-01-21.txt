Have you ever been told you're boring?

There was a commercial where Hideji Otaki shouted at Itoku Kishibe, "Boring, your story is boring!" It was an ad for insecticide, but that line was just incredible. I've only recently realized this, but have we ever seen a scene where someone yells at another person for being boring? Criticisms like "You're wrong" or "You're hard to understand" are one thing, but was it ever acceptable to criticize someone for being "boring"? Honestly, most conversations in this world are dull, so perhaps everyone just agreed not to mention it. The character played by Itoku Kishibe probably thought, "Are we allowed to say that?" and was caught off guard.

That's right—most conversations are boring. It's normal for them not to be very interesting. However, there are some that are genuinely "interesting." People who tell these "interesting stories" are what we call "interesting people." Here's the crucial part: these "interesting people" aren't inherently fascinating themselves; rather, it's what they see and hear that's compelling. For instance, imagine someone observing ants. They watch them with a sense of wonder. Just by talking about it, that sense of wonder is conveyed. It's not just that the ants are interesting; it's the person's "eye" observing them and the "heart" connected to that eye that creates the sense of intrigue.

On the other hand, those who are told they're "boring" probably aren't seeing anything interesting. Their heart, connected to their eye, is likely in a place far removed from anything captivating. In reality, Itoku Kishibe's character in the commercial was merely explaining the product, so of course, it wasn't interesting. The amusing part was Otaki's angry outburst. May the world be as interesting as possible.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. The commercial is from 2003, so younger people might not know about it.
