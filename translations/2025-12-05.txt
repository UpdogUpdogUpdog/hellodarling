Thoughts on the Idea of "Spaciousness"  
Shigesato Itoi

・There’s something undeniably captivating about things I don’t fully understand yet. It’s like having this vague image in my mind without knowing how to articulate or even think about it. And yet, it feels incredibly intriguing. Perhaps it’s just the idle fantasies of a dreamer, or maybe it’s the kind of thought that vanishes once you delve into it. It’s like a scene from a manga where a young girl wonders, “Is this what love feels like?” while her heart races.

Here I am, attempting to talk about something I don’t quite grasp myself, and I find myself writing it down for a large audience. But this isn’t about the current trend of “verbalizing” things. No, this is just me expressing that I’m having a good thought, even if I don’t understand it. I’m simply saying that my emotions are stirred. To you, the reader, this might be dreadfully boring. It must seem like I’m just rambling, with no one understanding what I’m saying or thinking. It’s akin to a small child talking to themselves while home alone. Yet, in truth, I’m actually quite excited.

Although I can’t even sketch the outline of my thoughts, if I had to say something, it would be about the concept of "spaciousness." Cities, particularly Tokyo, have become too cramped. Lately, I’ve been mentioning this quite often. We need to reclaim a sense of "spaciousness," or our perceptions—and even our thoughts—will become narrowly confined. Thus, I find myself seeking places where I can physically experience "spaciousness." I talk about places like "Oze" and "Akagi." However, just today, while in Akagi, I realized that the "sense of spaciousness" I had felt was actually quite limited. The true "spaciousness" was something far beyond that, and the realization hit me hard. This might sound nonsensical, but that’s how it is. For now, I’ll call this "Neo-Heroism."

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. By the way, Tokyo is too cramped. There’s something good about that too, though.
