Prohibitions Aren't the Enemy of Freedom  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Back from Tokyo.  
I left "Chōzōkoya" and walked for a little over an hour along the "wooden path."  
The trail winds through meadows like flower gardens, up and down gentle slopes.  
After a series of transfers—a ride on an electric bus, then our parked car—it took about two and a half hours before we finally boarded the bullet train at Nasushiobara Station to head back to Tokyo.  
Counting just the travel time, it’s over five hours, so it’s hard to call this a convenient or close tourist spot.  
Oze, this "realm of dreams," is far from convenient.

In Oze, there are no roads for cars.  
The only paths are wooden walkways for people to tread.  
The buildings here weren't constructed with materials delivered by car.  
Ingredients for meals, clothes, various tools, even snacks—whether books or toys—are either flown in by helicopter or carried on people’s backs.  
Sure, if cars could get through, it would undoubtedly be more convenient.  
But changing that rule is simply not an option.  
Visitors are expected to carry their own belongings.  
Before you know it, you'll notice there are no trash cans anywhere in Oze.  
That's because everyone is expected to take their trash home with them.  
Entering the marshland or collecting plants and animals is prohibited.  
You might think fishing would be delightful, but that's just a thought.  
Oh, and bringing pets is not allowed either.  
For city dwellers, it's inconvenient in every way.  
It's full of prohibitions, and nothing is in excess.

Yet, there's a moment of realization.  
These "prohibitions" aren't imposed by outsiders;  
they're decisions we've all agreed upon, myself included.  
If things were more convenient, this place would lose its essence.  
If things were easier, these experiences would be lost.  
If it were more casual, it wouldn't be this kind of place.  
Knowing this, people commit to the rules with resolve.  
This "realm of dreams" called Oze lets the winds of so-called "progress," which equates everything with "freedom," pass by like a breeze through willow branches.  
Even so, people of all ages, including first graders, come here, leaving with sweat and smiles from this prohibition-filled paradise.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today as well.  
To put it earnestly, there's so much to learn from Oze.
