Sleepy eyes. The movie "Concocted."

Shigesato Itoi

・Alright then, I'm about to write something utterly trivial today. Or so I thought as I sat down at the keyboard, but I feel sleepy. There are all sorts of ways to feel sleepy, you know. Sometimes, I say it like this: instead of being entirely sleepy, right now, my "eyes are sleepy." Staying awake isn't hard, and I'm full of energy to work! But since my "eyes are sleepy," I'd really like to give them a rest if I could. To rest them, I suppose I should just close them. Maybe I should close my eyes, since they're the only part that's sleepy. It seems like lying down would be more convenient than sitting in a chair if I'm going to close my eyes. I don't plan on sleeping; I just want to rest my eyes. This sort of thing happens a lot. And so, I often end up lying on the sofa and closing my eyes. Then why is it that, even though I'm not sleepy, I fall asleep? I was only supposed to have "sleepy eyes," but I end up dozing off. (And with that, I'll finish this story for now. I was aiming to write about something trivial, but I fell asleep before I got to write anything trivial).

・Now then, my "eyes are still sleepy," and I think it's because last night, after deciding to go to bed, I started watching a movie. I only intended to watch the beginning of "Concocted: The Man Called a Murderous Teacher," but I couldn't stop and ended up watching the whole thing. The title alone is a spoiler, isn't it? Stellar performances by Go Ayano, an intense portrayal by Kou Shibasaki, and Kaoru Kobayashi at his best. It's the story of a man who was labeled a murderous teacher because of a "concoction." You practically know the plot without even watching it. But once I started, I got so wrapped up in it, feeling frustrated alongside the protagonist, getting stuck in a quagmire with no idea how to get out. Even though you know how it ends—the name is cleared—you can't help but want to see it through, enduring the aggravating moments. It's a movie based on a true story, and really, it makes you grit your teeth. "Concocted" can be incredibly powerful once it gains momentum.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. There I was, getting all excited at dawn, shouting, "Way to go, Kaoru Kobayashi!"
