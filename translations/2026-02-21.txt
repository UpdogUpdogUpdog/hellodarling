Not Everything's Bad...

・It might sound odd saying this outright, but you hardly ever see good news. Maybe there's a bit when it comes to sports, just a bit. But day in, day out, it's mostly bad news being reported. Domestically, internationally, past, present, future—it's all as you'd expect. Yet, despite this, I find myself thinking that perhaps we need to know more about these grim stories and dark truths. So, I dive into studying all kinds of bad news. There's a mountain of things I can't do anything about, and some things where maybe I can make a small difference. But overwhelmingly, it's the things I can't change. Even so, trying to form thoughts about them takes time and effort. If you earnestly engage with bad news, you risk becoming someone who spends most of their life worrying over it. There are people who, from the moment they're born, spend their entire lives in sorrow, ending it all in worry. I get the feeling some people actually live like that. It might sound funny to say, "No way, not you?" but if I'm not careful, I could become one of those people too. I'm serious—whether it's in small doses or large, we're all on the edge.

In a world seemingly filled with nothing but bad, how is it that we manage to live day by day? I wonder. Perhaps it's because, no matter how saturated the world is with negative news, there are those small, comforting moments, acts of human kindness, adorable people or creatures, and beautiful things scattered like stepping stones. We have time to hop from one stone to the next, poking out from the murky surface of dark news. And maybe—just maybe—those stepping stones, though small in total area, keep stubbornly appearing one after another. Perhaps that's what we believe. If everyone truly started to believe that "there's no such thing as human kindness," then kindness would truly have nowhere to go.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. Surely, since ancient times, it's been mostly bad news.
