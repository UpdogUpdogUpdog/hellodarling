I suddenly felt the urge to create my own vitality.

It's not uncommon to hear people say they "received energy" after attending a concert. Just the other day, I genuinely felt invigorated at a concert by Sadao Watanabe, the jazz legend. He walked onto the stage with a smile, dressed in a dapper suit, and gifted us an evening filled with delightful music. It was pure "music"—every note seemed to be having a good time. I hadn't imagined he'd be so full of life. Later, I checked his age online. To my astonishment, I discovered he is 92 years old. Wow, I can't keep complaining about age or fatigue anymore. I understand that everyone has different levels of energy, but seeing 92-year-old Nabe Sada playing the sax with such enthusiasm and joy—even when he wasn't playing—made me feel like I should be living that way, too.

And then yesterday, there was Tokyo Dome! "This is my first concert of the year," he said. Everyone was quietly wondering just how lively Ei-chan would be. Young people, people of the same generation—all of them were imagining it in comparison to their own condition. Tokyo Dome was packed, not a single space left. Within the first couple of songs, I thought, "He's even more energetic than last year." Is it okay to be this loud and full throttle? Can he really keep this up? Will he slow down at some point, or what's going to happen? Those thoughts crossed my mind, but eventually, I stopped worrying. For about two hours, this 76-year-old was unstoppable. Who knows how much he moved across the vast stage of Tokyo Dome? How much air did he take in and release while singing? I was astonished. I'm the same age as him now. What kind of training did he do to prepare for this day? He must have been quite disciplined and made adjustments, yet it felt like witnessing a "miracle that's not a miracle."

It's easy to say, "I got energy," but I've decided not just to say it, but to "create energy" myself.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
I'll be heading to Kofu for a talk on a Sunday afternoon.
