Revisiting Memories  
Shigesato Itoi

・When I'm in Kyoto, I find myself eager to take photos. I want to capture the unchanged essence of things. Though I know, deep down, that everything is subtly evolving. I'm aware of this, yet things seem unchanged. But perhaps it's me who has changed. As the years go by, people naturally transform.

The act of observing "what hasn't changed" and "what has" can be quite entertaining. While gazing at the seemingly timeless garden, I perused countless old "photos" stored in my MacBook. From that time, and that time, and even further back. Memories that existed only in my mind somehow align perfectly with the old photos. The changes in the dogs captured in them are particularly amusing. Of course, these images also bring back memories of family and friends. I was vaguely aware that each photo was lying dormant, but revisiting them now evokes a myriad of thoughts. It's akin to "inspecting memories." Though "inspecting" sounds like a mechanical task, it's much more heartfelt. For example, realizing that the people who frequently appear in your photos are those you truly care about.

Currently, the word is out that something new is coming. The tagline is, "Living is about creating memories." It's only now that I feel I truly understand this notion. People create "memories" unconsciously. When you recall something and recognize it as a "memory," it becomes a "memory," yet even without that recognition, "memories" are constantly being formed. Revisiting memories might mean taking a heartfelt look at them. When I reflect on all the "memories" I've made, it strikes me—though it sounds a bit odd—"I've really lived a full life."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. How many times have I used the word "memory" here, I wonder?
