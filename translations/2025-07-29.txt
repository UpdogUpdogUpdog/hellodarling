Doing It Yourself  
Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»Have you heard about the series starting off on a relatively quiet note?  
  Nine writers from "Hobo Nikkan" take turns writing short pieces that can be read in about three minutes.

  It's all about trying different things. Build on the good stuff, and if it doesn't work, change it or stop. Each of them writes regularly anyway, and with just one piece due every nine days, you'd think they could take it easy. But when I asked, it turns out that's not quite the case. There's a sense of teamwork among the nine writers. They read what the others write, wondering, "How will they do it?" or "That's nice," and find the additional work enjoyable. I can understand that feeling. Yet, it seems there's also a unique kind of pressure that differs from anything they've written before. It makes sense, really. It's not about reading what someone else has written; it begins only when you yourself start writing. It's probably like standing in the batting cage during practice, hitting dozens of balls, versus stepping up to bat in an actual game, knowing it's all on you. The difference is as stark as night and day. It seems they've come to appreciate that feeling. And I think that's great, really great.

  Each of them mentions how, as their turn approaches, they start living with the thought of "What should I write about next?" Those who write regularly see the world through a writer's eyes. Oh, come on, are you just realizing that now? Well, it's fine. That's right, even if it's not your turn to write, shouldn't you always be living with the question, "What should I write about?" or "Is there an idea here?" I said this with a bit of irony, but I was quite pleased. When the moment comes, if you think "I've got nothing to write," then you can't write anything at all (laughs).

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Pressure is just another part of the experience. It exists because you're the one doing it!
