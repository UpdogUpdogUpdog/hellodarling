The Gift of Being Well  
Shigesato Itoi

・Right now, I'm doing fairly well. I make some effort to stay healthy, but I'm not pushing myself too hard. I've got help—dentists, doctors, trainers, and the support of people around me. It's not like I'm making extraordinary efforts to stay well. Yet, being in good health is a deeply satisfying blessing. It just so happens that I'm well.

People often talk about their good health as if it's their own achievement, but I've come to realize that's not quite right. There's no need to search for reasons like luck or the help of others. It's simply something to be grateful for. I've quoted Antonio Inoki's words here numerous times: "If you have health, you can do anything." And yes, I still believe it wholeheartedly. But the "health" in "if you have health" isn't the result of one's own efforts. Some people happen to be unwell, while others, like you and me, happen to be well. On that foundation, "if you have health, you can do anything."

From this moment on, let's truly appreciate our own measure of wellness. Perhaps, if we feel grateful for our health, it might slightly increase our chances of staying healthy.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. May those who aren't feeling very well find some measure of wellness.
