What kind of life can we lead, and where can we find it?
Shigesato Itoi

・Yesterday, in this very space,
  I wondered, "What would happen if we asked elementary school kids,
  'What kind of life do you want to live?'"
  I bet most kids—and adults too—haven't really thought about
  "what kinds of lives are out there."
  That's where I ended it.
  But afterward, I felt like there was more I wanted to say
  on the topic, so today, I'm going to dive a bit deeper.

  People go about living their own lives quietly.
  And that's perfectly fine. But in truth, without even realizing it,
  we often think, "Ah, that's a nice way to live," and
  we might aspire to live like that (even if we can't).
  We're influenced by watching things like a distant baseball player's actions,
  or feeling moved by the words and deeds of a manga character—hero or villain,
  or watching a documentary about a favorite idol.
  It could also be the way a teacher carries themselves or speaks,
  or resonating with a friend's sudden action during play.
  I think we gather inspiration from all sorts of places.

  The reason those who have come before us recommend reading a lot of books
  is because it lets us see the "many ways of living" that exist.
  Books don't just depict admirable or good people;
  they also portray the lives and thoughts of bad people,
  the seemingly ordinary folks who are, in fact,
  thinking and doing profound things,
  and the intricate relationships between people.
  Sometimes, life takes a sharp turn due to fate,
  and both weakness and strength can trigger events.
  Of course, beyond what's written in books,
  the stories and experiences shared by real people are invaluable.
  The content on "Hobonichi" (especially "Hobonichi School")
  might be doing the job of collecting such experiences.
  Perhaps "Hobonichi" is the modern-day catalog of "ways to live"?

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today.
Saying, "That's a good way to live," is the highest compliment, isn't it?
