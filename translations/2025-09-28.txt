Countless singers long to sing certain songs.

・These days, with smartphones storing more music than old record shops ever did, we can indulge in quite the luxurious listening experience. One such indulgence is the "listening comparison."

It all began when I discovered that many rakugo performers had recorded the piece "Nedoko." I started buying those CDs whenever I found them and loaded them onto my iPod. Eventually, music streaming services like Apple Music emerged, offering subscription-based access. Now, it's almost a given that if you search for something, you'll find it. After "Nedoko," I began collecting covers of "Eki," originally by Mariya Takeuchi. I won't delve into detailed critiques, as they could go on endlessly, but I find each artist's rendition fascinating in its own way. Furthermore, covering other artists' songs seems to have become a significant trend, with singers known for their vocal prowess delivering excellent performances one after another. I suspect this wave of covers might have been sparked by Hideaki Tokunaga, though I apologize if I'm mistaken. Of course, regulars like Naomi Chiaki, Aya Shimazu, Hibari Misora, JUJU, and Yasushi Nakanishi frequently delve into covers. Oh, and Koji Tamaki also released a cover album titled "Gunzou no Hoshi," which is a must-listen.

I've been pondering whether a song's quality could be measured by multiplying the number of covers by its sales. When I asked AI about this, it suggested that "Miagete Goran Yoru no Hoshi wo" might top the list, though that doesn't quite resonate with my intuition. (By the way, songs from the Hachidai Nakamura and Rokusuke Ei duo are truly outstanding—they're hall-of-fame material in my book.) On a side note, my gut tells me that "Love Me Tender" might be the most widely covered foreign song by various artists.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. I imagine the most popular karaoke songs are a different matter altogether.
