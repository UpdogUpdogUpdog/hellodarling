The Unchanging and the Ever-changing. Learning from the Past to Understand the Present.

・Things that are meant to change, will change.  
Even if you think they shouldn’t, when the time comes, they will.  
You can try to stop it by force, but what’s destined to change will change.  
Sometimes, you might even feel the urge to change yourself.

On the other hand, some things remain the same.  
Even if you wish they would change, certain things stay as they are.  
And sometimes, the things you hope will stay the same, do just that.

When big events or incidents occur,  
we tend to think that everything will change.  
Yes, many things might indeed change.  
But, you see, many things also remain unchanged.

Talking about change tends to attract attention;  
people listen more when you emphasize change.  
That’s why everyone makes a fuss about it.  
However, eventually, like a fever cooling, things often revert to their original state.  
After a major earthquake, a global pandemic,  
the rise of the internet, or now with AI,  
even the excitement over election results will gradually fade.  
Of course, some things will change for better or worse.  
But nothing changes entirely.

I know, I’m stating the obvious, right?  
Even as I write this, I realize how obvious it is.  
When pondering the phenomena of change and constancy,  
I stumbled upon the perfect expressions: "The Unchanging and the Ever-changing" and "Learning from the Past to Understand the Present."  
These words have existed since ancient times, resonating with each generation as if to say, "Exactly."  
The fact that these truths have remained unchanged is, in itself, unchanged.  
Humanity has always acknowledged both the unchanging and the ever-changing,  
never just one or the other.  
When people are in a rush or set in their ways,  
they tend to lean towards one side.  
To find a good word for this,  
well, that’s precisely what it means to "stay calm."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today.  
It's probably a good idea to break the habit of viewing everything in opposition.
