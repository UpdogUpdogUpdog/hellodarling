The thing about compassion—

Shigesato Itoi

I often joke about wanting to give my younger self a good talking-to. It’s partly a joke, but there's truth in it. My younger self was really a piece of work. Not that my current self is anything extraordinary, but compared to the past me, I’m at least a bit better. It’s not like everything was terrible back then; there were some good points. But if there was one crucial thing I lacked, it was compassion.

Confucius was once asked by Zilu, "Is there a single word that one can practice throughout life?" To which Confucius simply replied, "Is it not 'shu'?" It's amazing, really—just one character. It's read as "shu," which means compassion. He declared outright that the most important thing is compassion.

That compassion was something my younger self simply didn’t have. My current self has come to realize this.

But you know, compassion isn’t something that naturally wells up in good people. If you don’t know it, it doesn’t exist. That's how it is. For instance, dogs used to be kept outside, mostly chained up, with little concern for the cold or heat. They ate leftovers with just a splash of miso soup. Honestly, my younger self didn’t have the kind of compassion my current self does for those dogs. I thought that was just how dogs were kept. In human relationships, too, there were many instances where I lacked compassion. I later realized that there were countless things I accepted as just "the way things are," without ever questioning them. I’ve probably become aware little by little and have tried to correct myself gradually. Because my younger self lacked compassion, I likely hurt people. It might have taken me years, even decades, to recognize some things. I can’t apologize or make amends for each one, but I want my current self to be at least a bit better.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Don’t do to others what you wouldn't want done to you. That's compassion.
