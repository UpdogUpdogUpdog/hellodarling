Skill. Nakagawa Brothers. Hot Pot.  
Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»At school, we had something called a "skill test."  
There were also things like "midterm tests" and "final exams," but those had scheduled dates and announced topics.  
You just had to study the specific material for that time.  
Well, you "had to," but really, I didn't.  
I just stayed up late and ended up sleep-deprived.  
However, the "skill test" was shrouded in mystery.  
I never quite understood when or how it would happen.  
There might not even have been a defined scope.  
The good part was that no prior studying was necessary,  
so no effort or preparation was required,  
and I preferred these "skill tests."  
Not that I performed any better on them, though.

Looking back, I realize the "skill test" was meant to evaluate "innate ability."  
Unlike student days, in the real world, almost every challenge feels like a "skill test."  
Scheduled scopes and dates are only for newcomers or those with little experience.  
There's no midterm or final here.  
The most important task is always finding "the answer nobody really knows."  
Sometimes, it's even about identifying "problems never seen before" and hunting down their solutions.  
Thinking about it like that, all those midterms and finals,  
all that effort spent on memorizing tiny details,  
you just forget them after a while anyway,  
so maybe they were "unnecessary" after all.  
Frequent "skill tests" seem like a better approach.

The other day, I was listening to AM radio in my car,  
and two men with familiar voices, though I couldn't place them,  
were casually chatting about hot pot cooking.  
It was unscripted, just a random conversation,  
but it was incredibly entertaining.  
This must be what they call the comedic "skill," I thought.  
Later, I looked it up, and it turned out to be the Nakagawa brothers.  
I could have listened to their "hot pot stories" forever.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today as well.  
The kind of things you "need to know, even if by memorization" is changing.
