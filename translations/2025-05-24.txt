Footnote: 
〈狙ってやる、を休め。〉 - "Take a break from 'aiming to do it'." The phrase "狙ってやる" roughly translates to "aiming to do it" or "trying to do it right," but its connotation is closer to "trying too hard" or "overthinking it." 

The essay:

When I talk to producers of various visual works, I often discuss the concept of "aiming to do it" (狙ってやる). Of course, anyone can do it, and in most cases, people do "aim to do it." That's why we can take multiple tries, like Take 1, Take 2, Take 3, and reproduce the same thing even under different conditions. To some extent, we can create a manual for how to do it, and even teach it to others. Especially with the advancement of digital information, being able to reliably produce the same thing in large quantities is crucial. However, as this progresses, everyone starts to "aim to do it" in the same way, and as a result, we see an increase in reliable but unremarkable products. While this might not be a problem for practical items, it's a different story for "content" (works or performances). When it becomes too reliable and unremarkable, it loses its value as a product.

In the past, we sought value by "aiming to do it," but now it seems like it's better not to "aim to do it." On the contrary, I think that's exactly what we should do. Even I, who used to say "it's not that simple," have come to think that way. But when I take a deep breath and reconsider, I realize that not "aiming to do it" is actually better. "Aiming to do it" becomes an automatic behavior, like looking ahead or taking a step forward. People living in the present naturally "aim to do it." That's why we should courageously choose not to "aim to do it" with a sense of joy and excitement.

You might think I'm speaking nonsense, but if I were to summarize it briefly, it's about taking a break from "aiming to do it." When a baby looks at you, do they "aim to smile" or not? Thank you for coming to "almost daily" today.

Those who are not good at "aiming" are fortunate. Heaven belongs to them.

Note: The last sentence is a play on a Japanese idiom, "狙うのが不得意な人は幸いである。天国はその人のものです" which roughly translates to "Those who are not good at aiming are fortunate. Heaven belongs to them." The idiom is often used to describe someone who is carefree and doesn't worry too much about achieving perfection.
