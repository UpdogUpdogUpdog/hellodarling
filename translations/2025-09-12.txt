All things under the sun are, for the most part, the creations of others.
— Shigesato Itoi

・Songs that have been sung, songs being created right now—naturally, I know almost none of them. There are countless songs that someone, somewhere, has crafted and sung.

In the same way, there are comics that have been drawn, and of course, I've read only a fraction of them. There are innumerable comics sketched by someone out there, especially in Japan, where there exists an overwhelming volume of manga.

Movies that people have made, films that have existed, those being made as we speak—I've seen scarcely any. The world is teeming with an astounding number of films.

When it comes to songs, comics, or movies, you might feel like you can grasp it somehow. But everything, absolutely everything, has been made by someone. Famous bridges, historic buildings, unnamed bridges, ordinary houses—all crafted by someone, by many someones.

And that means, quite simply, that I am unfamiliar with almost everything, and I haven't created any of it.

The world is brimming with creations by people who aren't me, and I'm not even aware of that fact. Even as I'm oblivious to my ignorance, the world continues to be shaped by those who aren't me.

Not just the things humans create, though. There is far more that nature has brought into being. Mountains, seas, skies, earth, the moon, stars, and even tiny bugs—they aren't human creations, yet they exist.

Everything resides within my own subjective experience, but truly, all things exist even without me. All that is outside myself lies beyond my subjective world. So, in essence, it's alright to feel at ease.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. I wonder why these thoughts sprang up now. I just wrote what came to mind.
