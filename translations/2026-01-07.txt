On Consuming Information  
Shigesato Itoi

・"These days, we're not really eating ramen, we're consuming information," said someone from Ippudo a long time ago. I remember feeling a connection to that statement. Eventually, this phrase made its way into manga characters' dialogues, and "consuming information" became a popular saying. That could have been the end of it, just a passing trend, but today, right now, a new thought struck me.

Today is January 7th. We partake in "nanakusa-gayu," a rice porridge with the seven spring herbs. Let's pretend to be knowledgeable and recite them: seri, nazuna, gogyō, hakobera, hotokenoza, suzuna, and suzushiro. Indeed, "seven herbs." Among them, only the leaves of suzuna (turnip) and suzushiro (radish) are what you'd typically call vegetables. The rest, including nazuna (shepherd's purse), are all wild grasses. It's said we eat this porridge to pray for health and longevity, but it's not like families are jumping for joy saying, "Yay, it's nanakusa-gayu day!" Nowadays, you can find "nanakusa-gayu sets" in stores, but no one eats it because it's delicious and wants more (though, as soon as I say this, someone online will surely chime in with, "I love it!"). It's not about taste or desire; when you think about it, we're consuming a prayer (information) for "health and longevity."

Speaking of which, even osechi-ryori, our traditional New Year's dishes, each has its own meaning. While there are practical reasons like preservation, they're all filled with puns and prayers—like joy from kombu, diligence from beans, celebration from sea bream, and fertility from herring roe. We've been consuming this information, this symbolism, all along, haven't we, we Japanese people?

In today's gourmet craze, consuming trivia (information) is also part of the experience. Just eating something delicious isn't enough. The stories behind the food add an extra layer of flavor. In any case, our household will likely partake in consuming the prayer that is nanakusa-gayu.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. If you really loved it, you'd be eating nazuna regularly, wouldn't you?
