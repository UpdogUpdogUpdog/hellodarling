A Life of Bluffing  
Shigesato Itoi

・From the moment I was born,  
　I've been pretending to know things,  
　and even now, I can't seem to stop.

　I've told my fair share of lies,  
　but compared to bluffing,  
　those lies are far fewer.

　My habit of pretending to know began  
　clearly in early childhood.  
　I no longer understand how to live  
　without putting on this act.

　I speak of things I barely know, as if I'm an expert.  
　When I hear something unfamiliar,  
　I nod along knowingly.  
　Sometimes, I even throw in a "Right, right."

　But when you ask, "What does that mean?"  
　it seems rude to interrupt the flow,  
　though sometimes it's unavoidable.  
　Conversations have their own currents.

　If you keep asking questions, the discussion stalls.  
　That's part of it too.  
　Without bluffing,  
　I'd have to admit I know almost nothing.  
　And yet, despite knowing almost nothing, I pretend.

　There have been times when two bluffs  
　engage in a conversation of bluffs.  
　Since both parties are just pretending,  
　neither realizes the other's act.

　Even if I want to curb my bluffing,  
　I find it impossible to quit.  
　After all, even today, there are kanji I can't read,  
　and I've somehow finished reading a text I didn't understand.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today.  
I suspect I'll write my will with a touch of bluffing, too.
