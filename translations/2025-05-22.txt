〈Looking Up and Walking, and Rolling Sushi〉

Lately, it seems like I've been talking about nothing but this sort of thing, but since it's reality, I'll just write it down as is.

I attended a funeral. The deceased was someone who had a long, gradually worsening illness and passed away at the age of 80, loved by both family and many others. 

When they were young, they were apparently the type of person who could make adults and children alike burst out laughing with their humor. 

At the funeral, the song "上を向いて歩こう" (Look Up and Walk) was played. This song is bright yet sorrowful, sorrowful yet bright. You walk while trying not to cry, pretending to be strong and taking steps. 

The bereaved mother said, "This was their favorite song." So that's what it was – they loved "上を向いて歩こう." 

I found out that my slightly older "otousan" (father figure) had told the mother that this song was their favorite. 

It may be just a small thing, but it felt like I had learned a lot about the deceased person. 

The person who loved "上を向いて歩こう" had left this world, and the song was flowing right there at that moment. 

During the wait for the cremation, we had a meal. Unlike the adults', the lunchbox of the daughter's daughter contained sushi in a car-shaped container. 

I finished eating my share and asked the daughter's daughter, "Can I have one of those?" 

There were three small rolled sushi left. 

She didn't respond and just kept looking away. 

I didn't expect to be refused rolled sushi. 

The daughter sitting beside her explained, "She likes it, so she kept it." 

So that's why she liked rolled sushi. 

It wasn't that I couldn't have any, but it was a shame, and that's how it was. 

That's how it seemed, and I showed my seniority by asking for one, and she reluctantly nodded. 

When I look back on this funeral in the future, it will surely be about "上を向いて歩こう" and "かっぱ巻き" (rolled sushi).

Thank you for coming today, a "ほぼ日" (almost day). 

This week, I have three days of wearing black clothes. Today, I'm in Kyoto.
