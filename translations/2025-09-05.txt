Unread Title: "Bari Mountain Trek"
by Shigesato Itoi

・I picked up a novel for the first time in a while, and it turned out to be really engaging.

The reason I got into it was an article written by someone who frequently appears on "Hobo Nikkan." She mentioned a man who often writes at a café she frequents. She mused that he might be a novelist. Then one day, she saw him on TV during a news segment about the Akutagawa Prize. There he was—the café guy. That’s the kind of moment that makes you go "Wow!" and feel delighted, right? I thought, "As expected of Nami Kishida, she attracts all sorts of interesting things," and decided to buy the award-winning book myself. I bought it with the intention of reading it eventually. Honestly, I didn’t even bother to check if it was "Paris" or "Bari," or how to pronounce "Mountain Trek," or even how to read the author's name, "K. Sanzō Matsunaga." Pretty careless of me, but until I started reading, it couldn't be helped. I vaguely assumed it was about something near Paris or Bali, and a year passed just like that. It wasn't until recently that I noticed the novel was available on Audible, and when I started listening, I found it fascinating.

"Bari" turned out not to be the Paris of France but actually "Bari." And it wasn’t the island of Bali in Indonesia, but a "concept." Apparently, for those who know a bit about mountain climbing, it immediately makes sense—it refers to a variation route that veers off the main trail. It might mean seeking out your own path as you go. The setting is supposedly Mount Rokko in Kobe, so it doesn’t quite feel like a mountain expedition. Yet, it seems it can be very dangerous without the right experience or skills. The descriptions in that part are vivid and intriguing. The novel itself starts with a story about a small to medium-sized enterprise, but gradually veers off the seemingly obvious path, leading into a "Bari Mountain Trek." It unfolds into a friction between the protagonist, who is also the narrator, and a senior who embodies the "Bari Mountain Trek" spirit. I switched to reading the physical book midway, but both listening to the Audible narration and reading were enjoyable.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Perhaps it’s a companion piece to "裏表の作品."*
