The Luck of Being There at That Moment  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Even for myself, and for "Hobo Nikkan," we've done a lot of things with a sense of "nervous anticipation." In other words, things that make us feel scared and jittery. If I wanted to sound grand, I'd call it "adventure." And from the perspective of someone responsible, it would be about saying, "Don't worry even if you fail." It's hard to pinpoint specific examples when asked, but looking back, it's been a series of such moments. We often dive into things we're amateurs at, trying our hands at what's never been done before. I remember at one event, our catchphrase was "Leap into the sea of failure." By saying that, even if things didn’t go well, we could maintain our composure. This kind of bravado, I feel, is crucial both for creativity and for being human. Somehow, that's where the next thing begins.

Even though everyone was busy preparing with calm faces, deep down, I'm sure there was a lot of "nervous anticipation" going on. Really, when in everyday conversation does the word "chanson" come up? And yet, she appeared in "Hobo Nikkan." Originally an enka singer, she also sang jazz, but did anyone expect a "chanson" concert? And even if "Hobo Nikkan" were to host a concert, it would be an amateur effort by the team, who usually have other jobs. People called it "handmade craftsmanship," but we were definitely relying on that perception. To be honest, I'm not sure we fully understood who our audience was or how to appeal to them. She suggested it, and Okuno-kun kept adding things up as best he could, while everyone pooled their strengths. But… who would have thought such an amazing event would come to life! I'm sure everyone who was at Sogetsu Hall that night felt truly lucky. When "nervous anticipation" succeeds, it explodes into something spectacular!

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Ah, music is wonderful. It can express the deepest parts of our hearts.
