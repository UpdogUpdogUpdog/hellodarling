What Matters Most?
Shigesato Itoi

・Imagine that you've come to believe, "This is the most important thing!" Now, that "something" could be different for everyone, and the belief in it is undoubtedly sincere. However, not everyone will share your conviction that it's the most important thing above all else. Even if many people claim it is, what truly matters most differs from person to person, time to time, situation to situation.

In another era, it might have been "the nation" or "the emperor." That's what newspapers and schools taught, and maybe your neighborhood association, parents, and relatives echoed the same sentiment. Such scenarios are often depicted in morning dramas, aren't they? Yet, for some people, "mother," "lover," or "life" felt more important. Even if they couldn't voice it, that's what they believed.

Someone deeply dedicated to their work might say the same. "Baseball is everything," or "I dedicate everything to victory." Such sentiments resonate to some extent. But there will be times when you naturally realize, "There was something more important." Isn't it okay for that to happen?

"I am the most important person to you"—this is also valid. But remember, that "important person" isn't necessarily the "important person" for others. It might sound complicated, but it's just common sense. Each person has their own beliefs, and they're not wrong. However, you can't expect everyone else to share them.

As elections approach, uncompromising disputes arise everywhere about what matters most. I believe people are speaking earnestly and acting sincerely. But it's impossible for everyone to think the same way. In the midst of it all, we can only search for the "lesser evil" that everyone can accept. It might seem like a half-hearted approach, and some might object, but what you consider important isn't necessarily what I consider important.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. Is the belief that the front page of the newspaper is what matters most really true?
