On Raising Children  
Shigesato Itoi

・Yesterday, I wrote here that "deepening one’s understanding of children is akin to deepening one’s understanding of humanity." Arriving at this perspective involved numerous epiphanies. Watching my daughter raise her own child, I often found myself admiring her methods, thinking, "That's impressive." Curious, I'd ask her, "How did you come to do things this way?" More often than not, her answer would be, "I learned it at daycare." Another frequent answer was, "I read it in a book." Typically, these approaches made much more sense to me than what I had considered "common sense."

While it would be clearer if I laid out specific examples, there are simply too many to cover. To summarize broadly, much of the "common wisdom" of past child-rearing was based on "society's convenience" or "the parents' convenience." Often, parenting and education were about acclimating the child to the parent's set of norms. The parenting philosophies I admired seemed focused on helping children "truly thrive."

Isn't it similar in adult "organizations" and the like? Rules are rules, and education exists for a reason. However, the goal isn't merely adherence. While it's a crucial "foundation," to put it bluntly, simply having perfect "manners" doesn't make you successful or interesting. I believe adults, too, can continue to "thrive" as they grow.

Understanding children leads to understanding adults. It seems to encompass this idea as well: "Even if you focus solely on the parent-child relationship, it won’t necessarily thrive. (Omitted) Parent-child relationships are just one part of many human relationships."
