Pouring one's life into it. Naturally, with all one's heart.

Shigesato Itoi

I watched an appearance by 〇〇. This program features visits to various manga artists, blending in the perspective of a fellow professional, and every episode so far has been truly fascinating. This particular episode with Chica Umino had been announced in various places well in advance, and although I had set it to record, I found myself watching it live at the scheduled time.

This time, the process of creating the epic manga 〇〇 was shown in its entirety, making it an unbelievably generous program. I mean, you get to see everything—from the initial storyboard (the preliminary blueprint of the script) through revisions, assembly, editing, drawing, and completion—all of it. You can actually see Chica Umino pouring her life into what becomes 'March Comes in Like a Lion.' She's a very gentle and soft-spoken person, so the expression "fierce intensity" doesn’t quite suit her. Yet, you can definitely sense that she's "pouring her life" into her work. Perhaps it's like a pencil being whittled down, bit by bit. Though she doesn't appear on screen, there's no trace of suffering or hardship. When you think about it, even a mother raising her child is "pouring her life" into it, isn't she?

A single manga seems to be on the verge of being born, is born, and then grows. Every step of that process is naturally pursued with all one's heart, and even as I watched, I couldn’t help but become earnest myself. Having dabbled in "creation" myself, perhaps I resonate with the steepness of that climb. I just wrote it, but "naturally, with all one's heart" is a wonderful phrase. Seeing people or things like that gives me strength. It makes me feel like if I, too, work "naturally, with all my heart," things will go well. Ah, Saturday night, and I feel a surge of energy.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. I'm also deeply grateful to Naoki Urasawa for doing this series.
