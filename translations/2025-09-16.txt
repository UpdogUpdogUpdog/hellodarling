The kanji for "self" is written as 自分.

・You know that saying, "The character for 'person' shows two people leaning on each other for support"? It sounds a bit too convenient, but when you look into the origins of kanji, there's some truth to it. Take the character for "楽" (pleasure, music, comfort), for instance. Its roots trace back to a pictograph of a person dancing with bells in both hands. Thinking about how this character evolved from such imagery to mean music, joy, and ease is quite delightful, isn't it?

This might seem unrelated, but let’s talk about kanji. I usually write "じぶん" (myself) in hiragana, but when it's written in kanji as 自分, it strikes me as quite profound. It's like one of those "the character for 'person'" sayings. The character for "self" is written as "自ずから分ける"—to divide naturally. Now, let me take this in a slightly forced direction. "自ずから," meaning from the very beginning, implies that "self" is inherently separate. Separate from what? From everything else (in other words, the world). Yeah, that's right. The world consists of the world and the self. So, in a sense, the world equals the world plus the self. Conversely, the self equals the world plus the self. Isn't this delightful nonsense? It feels like something a middle schooler might ponder late at night, but it's a thought I've had for a long time.

We think we understand ourselves because we're talking about ourselves, but that's a big misconception. When you really delve into it, you realize that you understand yourself about as much as you understand the world—not very much. You want to trust in yourself, but at the same time, you find yourself unreliable. And why you feel or think certain things... well, upon closer inspection, it’s all pretty unclear. Still, I wonder if anyone will read this kind of rambling.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. I intended to write about something else but ended up taking a detour.
