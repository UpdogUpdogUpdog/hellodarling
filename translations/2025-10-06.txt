For some reason, I found myself thinking about natto.

・Natto has quite the reputation, doesn’t it?

Natto is delicious.  
Natto is nutritious.  
And natto, despite everything, is cheap.  
I used to dislike it, but now I love it.  
I've heard there are even scientific inventions using natto.

In everyday life, whether at school or work, it’s not a main topic of conversation. But when natto comes up, a surprising number of people speak highly of it.

Not everyone praises it, of course. There are those who say, "I can't eat it." Yet, even these opinions seem to reinforce the positive buzz around natto, coming off as a common counterpoint. People often respond with gentle encouragement, like "I hope you can enjoy it someday," which prevents any real conflict. This attitude is largely thanks to those who, over the course of their lives, have grown to love natto after initially disliking it. They understand what it's like to find natto unpalatable and therefore don’t push others too hard. They never forget, "I used to feel the same way." So, in a sense, natto can be quite the acquired taste. Maybe that’s why natto enjoys such a good reputation.

Maybe that’s why, perhaps ♪  
Natto rarely takes center stage in conversations, nor does it face widespread criticism. Unlike other dishes, you don’t see popular restaurants specializing in "natto meals." When a child asks, "What’s for dinner?" it doesn't seem likely they’d jump for joy at the answer, "Natto!" Even amidst the global Japanese food craze, natto doesn't seem to be in the spotlight. You don't hear much buzz about famous natto manufacturers either.

Natto is hard to hold in your hand, and it doesn’t quite fit in your pocket.
