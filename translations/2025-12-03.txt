Drawing Freehand  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Imagine you're painting a landscape. There are plenty of straight lines—buildings, roads, and the like. If your goal is to make those lines appear perfectly straight, then using a ruler might make sense. On a computer, you can simply specify two points, and voilà, a flawless line is drawn. But if you want to create something truly your own, you probably wouldn't reach for a ruler. Even if your lines wobble a bit, even if their thickness varies, you'd draw both the straight and the curved freehand.

I've often thought communication works the same way. When you're drafting a contract, writing legal documents, or discussing rules, "ruler-like expressions" become necessary. "Within 24 hours" and "more than 24 hours" are worlds apart. These are moments where precision is key. But when you say "about a day," whether it's 23 hours and 3 minutes or 24 hours and 20 minutes, it's generally acceptable. As long as everyone agrees on the sense of "about a day," it's fine. Sometimes, "about a day" might even stretch into two days, and no one minds. In human interactions, ruler-like expressions and freehand expressions often blend together.

In art, music, dance, and words, so much is created freehand. When you try to organize it all with a ruler, the original expression loses its charm. An actor being interviewed about a film might speak freely, but then the interviewer asks, "So the theme is family love, right?" imposing a ruler-like interpretation. Words like "love," "warning," "inequality," "tragedy," "earth"—there are many common rulers. Once a line is drawn with these rulers, everything seems to fit neatly. But do we really have to pull out a ruler every time?

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. It's okay to embrace being "ineloquent." After all, we're drawing freehand.
