Understanding children is understanding adults.

・Watching a newborn grow into a living, breathing being, I can't help but marvel at the miracle of life. A child who can do nothing but sleep, cry, and drink milk gradually begins to see, hold up their head, form expressions, laugh, eat, crawl, learn words, and walk... Every day, they acquire new skills, little by little.

As they start to walk and expand their vocabulary, a distinct personality begins to emerge, even in their small form. They develop unique emotions and individual thoughts, becoming something only they can be—a "me" unlike anyone else. Yet, the feelings common to all humans and the stages of growth that many children pass through often resemble one another. There are differences unique to each child and similarities shared among many, and research into these areas has advanced significantly.

I was born long ago, in a time when experiential "wisdom" about children existed, but not much "research." When I became a parent, there were famous child-rearing books by Dr. Spock and Michio Matsuda, but not the kind of "good knowledge" we have today. Thanks to my daughter having a child of her own, I've had the chance to learn from preschool teachers and delve into various parenting insights. I'm often surprised and impressed, thinking, "This has developed so much and is so fascinating." I truly hold modern early childhood education in high regard. The progress in understanding young children, who can't express themselves well, suggests that our "understanding of humanity" is also developing. After all, adults may seem articulate, yet often struggle to manage their true feelings. Deepening our understanding of children deepens our understanding of humanity, which I find incredibly intriguing.

I'm considering setting up a "Comprehensive Childcare Consultation" desk at the office.
