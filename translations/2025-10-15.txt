迎cing a Day of New Beginnings  
Shigesato Itoi

・Today, I really can’t help but write about this.  
  For about a month now, every time I’ve bumped into the team behind this app in the elevator or elsewhere,  
  I've found myself unable to resist saying things like "It's almost time," or just giving a knowing nod or a simple "Hey."  
  I get it—the mix of excitement and responsibility is this indescribable, solid mass sitting right there in your chest.

One day, an email circulated through the office from the person in charge,  
  detailing how we’d organize ourselves on the release day.  
  It asked for our cooperation in a matter-of-fact way.

It laid out the schedule: what tests would occur at what times,  
  when the preparations for the launch would begin, and when announcements would be made.  
  Afterwards, depending on whether there were issues or not,  
  it detailed where we’d gather to monitor things as they unfolded.  
  The "monitoring phase" would continue until a certain time...  
  If problems arose, we’d handle each case with a specific strategy, moving from step A to B to C...  
  I won’t bore you with the details, but the tension is palpable.  
  We’ve obviously polished it to a point where we can say it’s ready.  
  Still, we’ve prepared for every conceivable scenario.

Before tackling the question of "Is it fun or not?"  
  the first concern always has to be "Is it okay?"  
  Naturally, we've been readying solutions for the "not okay" situations as well.  
  Some might think, "Well, of course, that's just common sense."  
  And they’d be right—it is common sense.  
  But executing common sense flawlessly is no small feat.  
  That’s what comes across so strongly.  
  So, while I’ve been eagerly awaiting this day, I’ve also been quite nervous.  
  I think we’ve created something pretty good.  
  If you’re interested, come join our app community.  
  We’ll keep making it interesting and better from here on out.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today.  
I hope to find even more enjoyable ways to share things with you.
