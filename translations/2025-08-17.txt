On the Notices Posted in My Mind’s Neighborhood  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Once upon a time, when I worked with words professionally, I really needed to know whether a word was good or not. This process often took quite a bit of time. When a short phrase (usually an ad copy) was created, I would spend up to several months pondering whether it was the right choice or not.

I used to describe this process as “posting the copy in the neighborhood of my mind.” In my mind, there’s a little town where people live. I’d put up a notice in a spot where everyone would pass by. Over time, little by little, the mental passersby would start to murmur things like, “What’s this even saying?” or “Wait, there was a notice there?” or even “Oh, trying to sound clever, are we?” Occasionally, I’d even hear, “Wow, this is fantastic!”

Of course, this is a metaphor, an image. There isn’t actually a town in my mind, but I set up something like it in my head. When working on copy, even staring intently at those few words doesn’t easily reveal their worth. It might lead to making overly logical or reckless edits, just adding or cutting words. Instead, I place the words within a broader image. The town, the wall, the notices—these are scenes I usually forget in my daily life. I leave the “words” within that image. Since the answer doesn’t just appear as I expect, I occasionally introduce imaginary people to see their reactions and thoughts. It’s perfectly fine to bring in people I know for this.

…I had forgotten about this kind of meticulous and time-consuming approach for a while, but this year, I’m trying to be more conscious of it.
