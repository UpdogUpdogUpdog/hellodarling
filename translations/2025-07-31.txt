〈Tips? They Exist and They Don't.〉

・Lately, when I talk with people at "Hobonichi," I find myself saying things like, "What even comes of asking questions and getting answers?" It's a bit twisted, I know. Sorry for the confusion.

Take Ichiro, for instance. Would you ask him, "What's the secret to getting really good at baseball?" Well, maybe you would. Some people might. And let's say, hypothetically, Ichiro replies, "Make everything in your life subservient to baseball." Now, I just made that up, but if you took his answer as "the secret to getting good at baseball," I think you'd be right. You might even jot it down quickly on a notepad, thinking, "Ah, that's it. I get it now." You might smile to yourself, planning to give a similar answer if someone asks you a similar question. But really, it's just words flying from over there to over here.

Yet, if a high school student who's truly passionate about baseball, who desperately wants to get better, asks a senior this question, then "Make everything in your life subservient to baseball" could realistically become his secret. There's a saying, "Seek, and you shall find," but if you're just casually curious, it won't work. Knock from the place of "seeking," and the door will open.

I once succeeded in quitting smoking, but when I was just saying, "I want to quit. Any good methods?" I couldn't quit at all. It was only when I decided, grumbling all the while, "I'm going to do it," that I actually managed. There probably are secrets, but knowing them alone is just hollow.

Thanks for visiting "Hobonichi" today. Well, lots of business books also offer "secrets," but...
