On Artfully Putting Things into Words  
by Shigesato Itoi

・So, a rooster is crowing.  
The sound of that rooster exists as an undeniable fact.  
No matter where you're from, you'll hear the same crowing.  
But to Japanese speakers, it sounds like "kokekokko."  
To those who speak English, it’s "cock-a-doodle-doo."  
For Portuguese speakers, it’s "cocorocó."  
In Chinese, it seems to be heard as "wo wo wo."  
Italian speakers hear "chicchirichì,"  
and in Russian, it apparently sounds like "kukareku."

As we established at the beginning, the rooster's crow doesn't change to suit the listener's language.  
Yet, when humans translate what they hear into words, each language describes it quite differently.  
The same sound, once put into words, becomes something else entirely.  
I find this concept utterly fascinating.

Symbols in mathematics, decided by convention, remain the same no matter where in the world you are.  
Three is three, eight is eight, and 3 + 8 equals 11.  
Digital representations are entirely composed of ones and zeros,  
so the sameness remains consistent.  
But the sound of a rooster's crow is perceived differently.

To go further, consider a single rose in bloom.  
Each observer perceives it differently.  
A rose doesn't have predefined agreements like numbers do.  
How it appears to or is felt by each person is left unspoken and free to be.  
Some might choose the word "beautiful," but a rose isn’t inherently "beautiful."  
It’s just that someone decided to say it was.  
I find this notion incredibly appealing.  
"Artfully putting things into words" is really just translating the factual sound of a rooster into "kokekokko."  
When it works well, it can be quite useful.
