For the first time in my life, I said it.

・Ah, this is something I’ve thought about for a long time. I never voiced it out loud, nor did I ever plan to. But it just slipped out. 

I feel like it's thanks to getting older. Maybe as we age, things tend to slip out more easily. Though, I suppose it's something to be mindful of. Perhaps the situation just made it easier to say. There were three people I was meeting for the first time, three I was already familiar with, three members from “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun,” and myself. We were being treated to dinner. It was at a proper hotel’s Japanese restaurant.

Once everyone had ordered their pre-dinner drinks, the beer and small bottles of non-alcoholic drinks were brought over. Each bottle and its respective glass were placed in front of us. We hadn't yet gotten into the main topic. Just a bit longer—bear with me.

"Thanks for your hard work, thank you," everyone was saying, grabbing their bottles of beer or non-alcoholic beer, trying to pour into the glasses of those nearby. Oops, I had picked up a small bottle with my right hand, but without thinking about who to pour for, I ended up pouring into my own glass. The bottles searching for others' glasses were momentarily confused, hesitating over who should pour for whom.

Being the eldest, I couldn't help but say, with my drink-filled glass in my left hand, "Has pouring drinks for others ever really been beneficial?" Let's stop the pouring and just raise our glasses for a toast. Somehow, everyone agreed it made sense. For the first time in my life, I stopped the ritual of pouring drinks. Come to think of it, I've never seen anyone truly delighted by being poured for.

Thank you for coming to “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun” again today. The custom of pouring drinks probably dates back to when alcohol was more of a rarity, I suppose.
