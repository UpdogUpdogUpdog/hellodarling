Even the Karaoke Uncle has a past.  
By Shigesato Itoi

・I wasn't originally fond of music.  
I haven't forgotten that at all.

Before I started elementary school, I didn't mind singing. I sang along with everyone else at daycare. When I sang Misora Hibari songs in front of adults, they'd praise me and even give me a 10-yen coin. I was pretty thrilled about that. But then, during music class in elementary school, I suddenly became uncomfortable with it. I couldn't bring myself to stand in front of the teacher's organ and sing when it was my turn. I can't quite recall how it felt, but I just remember being troubled by my inability to produce a sound. My music grades were the only ones that suffered. My father found a piano class through an acquaintance and enrolled me. I was the only boy there, surrounded by girls, and I didn't like that either. I quit before finishing even one book of "Beyer." Since then, not only did I develop an aversion to piano and music, but also to lessons in general. Even now, I'm terrible with classes and schedules.

The amusing kids in class, those with older siblings, were well-versed in popular songs. I, too, was influenced and often sang the latest hits. I still remember the lyrics to this day. I liked every single song. Japanese pop songs kept evolving, and foreign pop music started airing frequently on TV. It became possible to connect with friends over musical tastes. Yet, singing from textbooks, whether in a choir or solo, remained a persistent challenge. That said, encountering the Beatles around the time I transitioned from middle to high school was truly fortunate. I learned the joy of savoring each song repeatedly. Trying to imitate them and start a band wasn't a bad idea. However, karaoke, which appeared out of nowhere, wasn't something I grew to like. The anticipation of my turn was anxiety-inducing. Still, singing with instrumental accompaniment felt somewhat gratifying.

I've chosen to gloss over all of this and pretend to forget it, and now I'm the "karaoke-loving uncle."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today.  
The joy comes from the combination of "amateurs + professional accompaniment."
