Why Do Old People Watch the News?  
by Shigesato Itoi

・As a kid, and even when I was young, I often wondered, "Why do old people only watch the news?" It seemed strange to me. The news wasn't entertaining, and watching the same stories over and over felt nonsensical. Even well into adulthood, I carried that sentiment.

Yet, despite all that, my home's big screen often displays news programs. Whether it's a TV I turned on or one my boss did, after flipping through channels and finding nothing of interest, we inevitably settle on the news. It seems that as we age, the loud, attention-seeking shows become more bothersome, and we gravitate towards something quieter.

But let's think about it, shall we? Are we truly satisfied watching the same news repeatedly? No, we're not. It’s undeniably the same stories—like the recent buzz about Prime Minister Takaichi or the endless footage of bears crashing into glass doors. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve seen those clips. Surely, there are more captivating stories around the world, yet every network ends up broadcasting the same news, likely because they can’t ignore what others are covering.

Moreover, is the belief that "being interested in current affairs and watching the news" is inherently "good" really true? Just like how a child reading a newspaper is praised, elderly people who frequently watch the news are often considered commendable. But what are we actually learning, thinking, or doing? Is feigning knowledge about current events or pretending to be concerned about the world truly a "good" thing? Now that I'm older, I find myself questioning it all over again.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan." Perhaps just the habit of watching TV makes one an elder.
