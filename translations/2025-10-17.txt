True Nonsense and Pseudo-Nonsense  
Shigesato Itoi

・This happened quite some time ago, and the person I'm referring to has already passed away, but there was this acquaintance of mine who was, in a manner of speaking, a "hacker type." He had this peculiar habit of messing with automatic doors. He’d stop, walk away, come back again, and repeat these actions just to see if he could disrupt the system that detected human presence. It was weird and a bit of a nuisance, but he wasn’t a bad person. I heard he once gifted a junior programmer a "random number program" for his birthday. The young programmer was delighted with it. I found the story quite amusing myself because, you see, computers can't actually generate true randomness—only programs that produce results that seem random. It's fascinating to think about. Even when humans roll dice, it may not be true randomness either. By now, in this future we live in, I imagine the tech world routinely uses "pseudo-randomness" that comes astonishingly close to the real deal.

Yet, even if we can create "randomness" like a dice roll, replicating the kind of nonsense, foolishness, and absurdity humans come up with seems a daunting challenge for AI. Just the other day, I asked our ChatGPT to tell me a funny story, but it wasn’t amusing at all. Apparently, it tries to create humor by following certain patterns or rules, but human laughter doesn’t work like that. Given the vast amount of information it holds, it could’ve searched for some "silly" story humans once concocted and presented it as if it were its own creation. I probably would’ve laughed at that. But that wouldn't be true creation, would it? The path to reaching "nearly human-level foolishness" might still be long... or maybe surprisingly short. Until then, as if buying time, we humans will keep engaging in our own brand of nonsense.
