A Restaurant Praised by Everyone, Yet Always Empty  
by Shigesato Itoi

・I've often sung praises and enjoyed the Chinese-style home cooking at the Aoyama Kohararyu Hall, but I've rarely talked or written about the Indian restaurant diagonally across from it. The place has a modern and upscale vibe. It's called "Sitara." Sure, it's nearby, but the real reason I frequent it is simply because it's delicious. It's not just a curry joint; it's a full-fledged Indian restaurant with many dishes I'm unfamiliar with. I've heard the head chef is from a five-star hotel in India, and you can truly taste the chef's skill in every dish. This isn't just flattery—those who've eaten there would agree.

Right now, I must be showering "Sitara" with compliments, right? Some might worry that if I keep praising it like this, it might get too crowded. But I doubt that's a concern. Despite our long acquaintance, it's always been a mystery to me that "Sitara" is perpetually empty. It's right across from "Fumin," which is always fully booked with lines out the door, yet "Sitara" barely has any customers, embarrassingly so. You can see inside through the glass, and it's almost always empty. As I mentioned, the food is really delicious (!). If you ask about the price, it's not cheap, but it's not exorbitant either. The staff provides earnest and dedicated service. If I had to guess, maybe the entrance approach is oddly narrow? Could it give off an impression of being too highbrow?

Just yesterday, my boss and I went there. We had biryani, sea bream curry, butter chicken curry, and a muscat and cheese salad. We also enjoyed some chaas and garlic naan. We left completely satisfied, yet the only other patrons were one other party. I'm not badmouthing it, really! I can't figure out why there are so few customers. Try searching "Sitara Aoyama," and you'll see it has great reviews, every article and opinion piece.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today as well. There must be other delicious, uncrowded restaurants like this all over Japan.
