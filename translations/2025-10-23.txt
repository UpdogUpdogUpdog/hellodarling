The Joy of Looking Forward to Tomorrow  
By Shigesato Itoi

・Imagining things like, "Wouldn't it be nice if this happened?" or, "I'd be so happy if I could do that." Or even, "I'd love to experience something like this." The ability to think and talk about a future that hasn't yet arrived with a smile is an extraordinary happiness in itself.

To others, it might seem like nothing more than an impossible dream or perhaps a one-sided love affair with the future, but wouldn't it be wonderful if everyone could savor that happiness? It's not particularly rare or complicated.

It's as common as a child waiting and believing that Santa Claus will come on Christmas.

Even an ordinary man, planning to hop on a train tomorrow just to enjoy a pork cutlet at his favorite restaurant, might not just smile but smirk at the thought—and that's its own kind of joy.

No matter how privileged a life someone might lead, there are those who can't smile or talk cheerfully about tomorrow or the future. This, too, is a common reality.

Yet, I still think it's wonderful to be able to joyfully imagine tomorrow, to have eyes that look toward the future with a bright gaze. Like children playing excitedly with friends or dogs bouncing around their owners—they themselves seem to embody a radiant future.

Writing all this, I'm forced to ask myself, "What about you?" And I realize, yes, I also have a future that I'm very excited about.
