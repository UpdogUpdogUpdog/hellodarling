Reflecting on how far we've come, I can't help but wonder—what does it all mean?

To us as individuals, human history feels incredibly long, yet in the grand scheme of Earth's timeline, it's but a fleeting moment. The very act of using symbols, like letters, to think and communicate is truly remarkable.

Imagine someone who isn't present leaving a message carved in stone, only for someone else to come along later and understand it. Spoken words are ephemeral, existing only in the moment, but once they're captured in writing, they can transcend time.

If you faithfully copy written words or images, the message multiplies, reaching more people. When those copies are not etched in stone but inscribed on leaves or paper, the message gains mobility, able to travel far and wide.

By carving onto wood or metal, then transferring ink to paper, a single message can multiply hundreds of times over. This is the essence of printing—a technology that spread widely and continues to thrive today.

Within this context, the global spread of the Bible occurred, and newspapers as a medium became wildly popular. The world’s happenings were printed in newspapers, allowing people to feel sorrow or anger about events in distant, unknown lands. Unknowns became part of the known, and this state became the "norm."

This outlines the evolution of printing using the symbol of "letters," yet digital media has raced through this lengthy history with astonishing speed. "Images" and "data" have erased the boundaries of past and present, near and far. In truth, this kind of "normal" isn't even magic anymore.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. It's my medical check-up day—time to assess what needs fixing and maintenance.
