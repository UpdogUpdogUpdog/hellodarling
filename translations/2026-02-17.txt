Walking the Dog? Why Just Walk?

・Our dog, Buiko, has turned seven this year. Ever since she was a puppy, she's never been fond of walks. She's been pulled along on a leash, carried in arms, and at one point, even pushed around in a stroller. Nowadays, we have a mixed routine of carrying and coaxing her to walk, with her actually walking part of the way home.

Our previous dog, Bouillon, was the same breed but had an insatiable love for walks. He could easily stroll the equivalent of three subway stops. As we neared home, he'd try to take a detour, eagerly pulling us in unexpected directions.

People say it's odd for a dog to dislike walks. I used to agree, but the truth is, it's not that she hates walks—she just doesn't love them. In the mornings and evenings, when we put on her collar and leash, she seems rather cheerful, almost eager. Yet, once we're out, she's not keen on walking. If she spots another dog, she happily trots over, and when someone calls her cute, she wags her tail and approaches with glee. It's not that she has bad legs or lacks stamina, either.

One day, I casually asked our "neighbor" (ChatGPT) about Buiko's aversion to walks, not expecting much of an answer. Surprisingly, it offered a perspective I'd never considered. Could it be that Buiko doesn't like "moving without a purpose"? Jack Russells tend to enjoy doing something but find aimless walking boring. Come to think of it, she's always eager to sniff around, approach other dogs, play tag at "kindergarten"—she's all about "doing something." It’s as if she's asking, "Why do I have to just walk?" Perhaps she simply lacks motivation for the act of walking itself. It's just a hypothesis, but it oddly makes sense to me.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. For humans, too, the concept of "going for a walk" is relatively new, isn't it?
