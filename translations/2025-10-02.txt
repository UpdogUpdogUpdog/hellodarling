Losing your sense of humor would be tough.

・During a casual chat on LINE with a friend, I suddenly thought, "You know, humor really is about saying the wrong thing," and I said it aloud. Here's a little amusing story to illustrate what I mean:

A group of refined ladies were gathered around a lunch table. Each of them was eagerly expressing how much they didn't like the food, wearing displeased expressions. They complained about everything: too salty, not salty enough, low-quality ingredients, the chef's taste being unbelievable—you name it. Then, a lady who was a bit late to join in the chorus of complaints hurriedly chimed in, her mouth still full, "Yes, and on top of that, such small portions!"

Now, it's not the kind of joke that makes you burst out laughing, but I quite like it and have remembered it. I believe it was from a Woody Allen book. The last lady's comment is what's "wrong" here. Everyone else was saying the food was bad, so it doesn't matter if there's a lot of it. Yet, she complained about the portion size, which, to the rest of the nitpicky ladies, was something that just shouldn't be said. Writing an explanation like this is a bit dull, of course. But even though she was "wrong," that's genuinely how she felt. Her misstep is what we might call the "punchline" in comedy, and in a way, it serves as a critique of the gossiping ladies present.

I had this thought and realized that in today's world, such humor might not be well-received. Words are defined as if they were mathematical symbols, constantly scrutinized for their correct meaning, and people are eager to pounce on any misstep. Words are treated like weapons or mechanical parts. But "right" coexists with "wrong," and sometimes "wrong" can create something "right."

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. "Humor" might sound like an old-fashioned word, but it's important.
