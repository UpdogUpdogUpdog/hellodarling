I tend to forget things, but I think that's okay.

・Yesterday, at "Hobonichi," we were quite a whirlwind—eating, talking, conveying, and changing things. I apologize for causing such a stir. Thank you so much to everyone who joined us. Especially regarding the changes in the site's design and usability, we were braced for comments like "I preferred the old version," but it seems most people have accepted the changes, and we all breathed a sigh of relief.

Still, I was astonished. Astonished by what "Hobonichi" has achieved over 27 years. How did we manage to do so much? How did we accomplish so many varied things? Even now, it amazes me. When someone tells me, "Remember when this happened?" I can recall it; I do remember. But to spontaneously recall what we did or what happened—that almost never happens. In broad strokes, I live having forgotten most of it. Sure, there might be experiences that have become a part of me, but day-to-day, they're completely forgotten.

Once I enter memory mode, my recollections come flooding back in vivid detail, but those opportunities are rare. Somehow, I feel like I'm always thinking about the "now." Yes, I do think about the "future," but I try not to focus on it too much.

If I were to put it in a roundabout way, maybe I genuinely believe that "the past and future are contained within the present" (or maybe I’m just forgetful and unplanned). Living in the moment while pondering the past or future seems impossible to me. Isn’t it enough to remember things when they come to mind?

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. Here's to embracing the 28th year of "Hobonichi" with us.
