Memorable Delicacies  
by Shigesato Itoi

・What kind of food do you like?

I've exchanged this question countless times throughout my life. I like all sorts of things, so even if nothing comes to mind right away, when someone mentions something, I often remember how much I like it.

Right now, I’d probably say "plain white rice." It's an easy thought because rice has been in the spotlight lately. That's one reason, but I've also taken an interest in cooking rice, and surprisingly, I haven't grown tired of it. It's the season for new rice, too, so my interest is heightened. I was concerned about the harvest, the heat of summer, but it seems we've safely arrived at a fruitful autumn. I've been thinking about rice far more often this year. And when I actually cook it, serve it in a bowl, and eat it, I genuinely think, "This is delicious." There’s no disillusionment between the imagined rice and the real thing before me. I could probably talk about rice all day, but we were discussing favorite foods.

Foods that come to mind easily are the ones you can't help but remember. Curry—I think of it often and eat it frequently. Sushi, too, whether it's from a convenience store pack or a high-end restaurant, I see it and eat it often enough that it comes to mind readily. Tonkatsu, always in my top three, offers a sense of indulgence and frequent opportunities to enjoy it. Ramen, now that's something else—a king in the content world, perhaps. It has casualness, variety, stories, familiar flavors, everything. And anything with red bean paste, though more of a snack than a meal, I absolutely love. Though it's pricey, so I hesitate to mention it, fugu sashimi and fugu hotpot are definitely favorites. Ah, rice is great, but let's not forget bread! Sukiyaki—I eat it because I love it, so much so I make puns about it. See, even though I'm listing foods that come easily to mind, there are still plenty I've forgotten—soba, udon, hamburg steak, omelets... And with that, I'll leave you to recall the rest on your own.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. We hope to be the kind of place that brings back memories.
