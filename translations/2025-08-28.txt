The Thing About Memory Switches  
by Shigesato Itoi

・The crew who went on that trip keep saying, with genuine warmth, how wonderful it was. Some have even coined the term "Oze Sickness," clinging to the memories of those three days spent in Oze.

No matter how profound an experience might be, it tends to fade over time. To keep such memories vivid, you need a "switch" that can bring them back to life. For instance, the music that played during those moments might serve as a switch, instantly reviving the memories. If someone who shared the experience starts recounting it, their words become a switch, illuminating your memory along with theirs.

There are various cases, but I believe that writing your own words is a particularly special kind of memory switch. No matter how accustomed you are to writing, translating thoughts into words or drawings requires a certain effort. This effort remains in your brain and heart as a memory, allowing even the smallest switch to unlock deep recollections. Even if you jot down just one line, like "I made her angry today," beneath a date, it carries significant weight. After all, you took the trouble to write it yourself.

・As the release date approaches, there's a subtle tension and energy in the office at "Hobo Nikkan." Even with everything seemingly in place, no one feels entirely at ease. It's a good thing, living through these days. No one fully knows what others are doing, yet everyone is supported by each other. And, of course, each person is also helping others. It might look the same every year, but you can tell it's getting a bit better, even if only slightly. I might just be a fan club member of "Hobo Nikkan."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Oh, and yes, I'm a good-natured assistant, too.
