Living means having memories.
- Shigesato Itoi

Life is fundamentally about creating memories. As long as you're alive, you can make memories. Put in a stark way, it's the simple truth that without life, there can be no memories. Of course, not all memories are pleasant. We talk about the follies of youth, or how being young often means being foolish, and many youthful memories are filled with things that would be unthinkable now. Some might say, "I never did such things," but I certainly did. Whether they're numerous or few, some of those memories are embarrassing. If the younger version of myself stood before me today, I'd have a good mind to lecture him. But even if the current me tried to advise him, that younger version probably wouldn't understand.

Whenever you feel you're doing something "wrong," that nagging sense acts as a brake. Even if you're just caught up in the moment, deep down there's something that resonates, and though you might rebel for a while, it eventually settles. When there's a fundamentally wrong idea, and both society and you are steeped in that mistake, it's worth reconsidering.

More troubling, however, is when you convince yourself you're right, acting on that belief, looking down on those who aren't aligned with your thinking, or criticizing those who disagree. Being convinced of your own righteousness can lead you to label others who impede you as bad or backward.

During life, you'll inevitably accumulate such memories. It's best not to forget them. You need to understand that with just a slight twist of fate, any possibility can become reality. Living means memories piling up, one after another.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. I hope there's ample space between each memory for everything else in life.
