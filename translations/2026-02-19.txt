The Fusion of Speech and Writing  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Once upon a time, writing was done in a formal, literary style.  
I often wonder how I would have managed if I had been born in that era.  
Of course, even during the age of literary language,  
people went about their daily lives talking,  
so there were expressions that captured spoken language.  
Storytelling and rakugo, for example, are mostly dialogue.

The style I'm using to write this essay now  
began in a different era, known as the "fusion of speech and writing."  
This idea was introduced to me by a respected mentor  
while I was on the verge of becoming a copywriter.  
It's a playful nod to Futabatei Shimei,  
the Meiji-era novelist and translator,  
and his concept of "unifying speech and writing."  
It was a bit of a joke, but a serious one at that.  
However, Mr. Tsuchiya merely mentioned "the fusion of speech and writing"  
in a small essay, without widely advocating for it,  
so perhaps I was the only one truly inspired by it.  
My impression back then was that the "unified speech and writing"  
we learned about in school was, when all was said and done,  
still a form of "literary language."  
While not as formal as the literary style,  
it was still a "writing style," and I wondered,  
why not bring it closer to spoken language?  
It was in this context that Mr. Koichi Tsuchiya's "fusion of speech and writing" emerged.  
Around this time, there was a movement toward  
styles that leaned more towards spoken language,  
like Rokujo Eiroku's "oral histories."  
I suspect that Tsuchiya's "fusion of speech and writing"  
originated from the scripts used for live TV commercials,  
but, as he's no longer around to ask, I can't be certain.  
In any case, it was a highly versatile style,  
allowing for the inclusion of the pauses of speech  
while conveying meaning through the written form.  
Ah, I've gone on too long when I meant to discuss something else,  
but it seems I'm out of time... Perhaps tomorrow.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today.  
But isn't it interesting that what you're reading now is also, in fact, "written language"?
