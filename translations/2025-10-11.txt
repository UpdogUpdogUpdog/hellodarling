The Land of Harmony, the Land of Impressions, JAPAN.  
Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»When we talk about "what we felt or thought" about something, we call it an impression (I want to scream it in big letters, but I'll let it slide). Remember those book reports we used to write? You'd read a book and write down your "impressions." Something along the lines of, "The protagonist did this and that, and I felt this way." Even when you travel somewhere, an adult inevitably asks, "How was it? What did you think?" seeking your "impressions." When you're enjoying a delicious meal, it's the same: "Is it tasty?" "How do you feel?" "What are your thoughts?"

And it doesn't stop when you're a kid. Even as adults, whenever you've done something or met someone, you're asked, "How was it? What do you think?" They want your "impressions." It really doesn't matter what you say. Whether it's as vague as "It was nice" or "I didn't hate it," that counts as an "impression." The person asking will nod and say, "I see." In baseball, too, they ask, "What were you feeling at that moment?" "What went through your mind when you hit the ball?" "How do you feel about your impressive performance?" It's always about your "impression." And again, anything goes because it's an "impression." "I just went for it," or "I tried my best," or "I was nervous" all work. They're not looking for "This is my opinion."

In Japan, from birth until death, everyone is constantly exchanging "impressions." Thanks to this, we have a vague but collective sense of what everyone thinks about various things. And from this, everyone learns what "generally is a good way to think," not as public opinion but as a shared understanding. The "empathy" that forms the basis of "harmony as a virtue" probably stems from everyone exchanging their "impressions." 

I'd love to hear your "impressions" on all this (laughs).

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. There's also the criticism of "That's just your impression, isn't it?"
