The hometown of "Hobo Nichi" is Kanda Nishikicho.  
Shigesato Itoi

・When I think back to when "Hobo Nichi" was moving to Kanda Nishikicho, the locals earnestly asked us, "Will you participate in the festival?" Our response of "Yes, of course" was no lie. We came here because we wanted to be a company with roots planted firmly in the local community. We've eagerly participated in all sorts of regional events, not just the festivals.

We've actively joined in the bustle of events famous nationwide. The tug-of-war tournament, now a highlight, was actually part of this "Goenichi" fair. We got so caught up in making the tug-of-war exciting that it almost seemed like the day was dedicated to it. But no, this is the "Kanda Nishikicho Goenichi." "Hobo Nichi" also runs a booth for "Twice the Fun Yo-Yo Scooping," a little invention of mine, so please check that out too.

・The Kanda Nishikicho "Goenichi" is organized mainly by the locals, but anyone is welcome, whether from all over Japan or even across the world. It might be a bit of a problem if it turned into something like the Osaka Expo, but I figure the crowd won't be that big, so we welcome onlookers of all ages. Back in the day, Kanda was known for its fiery spirit, with sayings like "Fires and fights are the flowers of Edo," which sounded both tough and dangerous. Nowadays, it's a happy, lucky local event. Come check out who takes home the tug-of-war trophy. Of course, we want other teams to do their best too, but if you cheer for "Hobo Nichi Hipparezu," our team would be overjoyed. We're a simple bunch, after all.

On such a day, I learned some news from a different angle. The neighboring Kanda Jimbocho station, close to Kanda Nishikicho, was ranked number one for 2025 by the British magazine "Time Out." Well, well, well, I guess that's true (hehehe).

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. I really feel glad we moved to Kanda.
