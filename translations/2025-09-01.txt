A Sudden Thought on "Life"

by Shigesato Itoi

"Art, you see, it's like capturing life," said Utamaro to Tsutaju in yesterday's historical drama. "Leaving a life that will one day fade away on paper. Maybe capturing life is my way of atonement. Lately, my heart feels a little lighter." The scene showcased the original artwork from "Gahon Mushi Sen."

The series "Berabou" has many memorable episodes, but this particular scene almost brought me to tears alongside Tsutaju, just as any ordinary viewer might. The line, "Art is like capturing life," is likely the scriptwriter's creation. Yet, it made me feel that all forms of expression, everything people do, are indeed connected to life. Whether it's Utamaro's intricate sketches, abstract paintings, or a child's doodles, I believe they all trace the path of life.

Music, too, sings life through voice and instruments, while dance expresses life's movements through the body. When people talk to each other, they convey life. Even casual banter is a back-and-forth of life. The everyday work of adults, which might seem routine and inconsequential, is, in fact, the use of life to assist other lives. It reminds me of how swallows build their nests—gathering grass, twigs, and mud from near and far to craft a home for their chicks to grow. Isn't that what human work is like when you think about it? Everything is doing something with life.

Even typing these words, one by one, is like building a swallow's nest—perhaps a bit clumsily. On this release day, these are the thoughts occupying my mind.
