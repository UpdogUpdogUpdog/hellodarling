Naked Apes and Hand Cream  
Shigesato Itoi

・It may be a bit late to start, but I’ve recently begun using hand cream, and I must say, it’s quite a delightful discovery. The launch of a new product prompted me to try it, and I realized my hands had been dry all along. Actually using it made me think, "Wow, this is wonderful." How did my hands endure being so dry for so long?

This has led me, once again, to ponder fundamental questions. Are humans the only animals that use hand cream? Monkeys don’t use it, nor does it ever occur to them to invent such a thing. Why? Because their hands are covered with fur. Most animals, like our dog, are covered in fur. They’re called "hairy creatures" for a reason.

Even humans have some remnants of hair. In the post-war Showa era, people had a lot more hair. I remember men's hands, arms, legs, and chests being noticeably hairier. Hasn't the overall amount of body hair in society decreased without us realizing it? In the Showa period, even famous figures like Shigeo Nagashima, Asashio, and Yukio Mishima were known for their chest hair—it was talked about as a sign of masculine charm.

Gradually, as time went by, body hair from all over seemed to disappear. Regardless of gender, all body hair apart from the hair on our heads started being "managed" and "taken care of." It’s as if we’re showing other animals that "hairy creatures" and "humans" are different, separate entities. Human body hair must have had its own purpose, however small. By getting rid of it, we ended up compensating with moisturizing creams and developing various functional undergarments. Not that I’m complaining, really.

But as we accelerate away from the "hairy creatures" group, I wonder, is this really okay, humans? What is it that humans truly want to become? Here I am, typing away with hands moisturized by hand cream.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" again today. I long for a richness that embraces both convenience and inconvenience, efficiency and inefficiency, going back and forth between them.
