Yesterday, I finally pulled my shoelaces tight.

No matter how old we get, there are still things we suddenly "realize." Things we've heard countless times but only now truly understand, making us go, "Oh, so that's how it is," or "Wow, really?" These moments are what make today and tomorrow exciting.

When there's a small child nearby, you can witness the process of them learning to do something new. In watching how they manage it, I often find discoveries for myself. I wonder if that's how I once learned things too. Things I've long forgotten suddenly reappear as new revelations.

Even the most trivial things around me seem to teach me something new almost every day. Just yesterday, I learned that if I earnestly lace up my sneakers from the toes upwards, they become incredibly comfortable to walk in. My feet had been aching a bit lately, and I'd been fretting over what to do. But once I thought to tie my laces snugly, I found myself walking with ease. In such moments, I reflect back a little. I remember feeling pain when wearing sandals or festival geta. Perhaps the motion of lifting footwear with the ankles isn't the best for my feet.

These personal discoveries often attract comments like, "You just figured that out?" or "There's an even better way..." from those who knew before me. I've grown accustomed to these "pioneer opinions," expecting them to exist. In the early days of the internet, though, they didn't sit well with me. Here I was, happy with my own little discovery, only to be met with "just now?" But I've come to understand that such people will always be around, and I've learned to speak my mind without worrying about it. After all, being "late to the game" is almost a given in life.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Since yesterday, I've become someone who laces up his shoes tightly.
