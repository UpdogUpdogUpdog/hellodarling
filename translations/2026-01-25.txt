We are the children of the candy house.  
by Shigesato Itoi

・There are so many intriguing books out there. Just the classics I haven't read yet seem countless. Books can teach us about things we want to know, so even if I'm not in love with them, there are plenty that pique my interest. There are comics that people rave about, towering like great mountain ranges. I've recorded numerous shows I haven't watched yet. It's not just fiction either; there are documentaries too. And of course, there's an endless stream of captivating stories on subscription services. Online, there's always some tempting tidbit of information catching my eye. Sports, too—beyond just baseball or soccer—are generally fascinating once you start watching. Lately, I've found myself unexpectedly engrossed in sumo wrestling. Only now have I come to appreciate the thrill of techniques like "oshidashi" and "yorikiri." 

Delicious food is in abundant supply, tempting me to cook and eat at home or dine out. Music—listening to the tunes I've always loved is a joy. I also feel the urge to explore music I've never heard before. Comedy, with its array of amusing personalities, always captivates me. I wouldn't mind attending more live shows.

I want to devour all these enticing things. Essentially, right now, I (we) am living as if in a candy house. Outside, it's a garden of sweets, and I'm perpetually wandering through a city of confections—a "child who loves candy." I'm eager to eat as much as I desire, and there's no one to tell me to stop. Instead, people encourage me, saying things like, "It's great that you have such an appetite," or "Does that look tasty? Is it delicious?" urging me to indulge in even more sweets.

Whether it's "information" or "emotion," isn't this relentless consumption of the candy house bad for us? Perhaps, we need something more akin to a fast from "all information," not just digital detox. But thinking too much about that isn't good either, so I search for something else interesting... oh, but that's not good too.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. Maybe, just maybe, we aren't playing enough.
