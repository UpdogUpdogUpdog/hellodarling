Reflections on Growing Older  
Shigesato Itoi

- Talking about aging as if it's some grand achievement,  
  or lamenting it as something overwhelmingly sad—  
  ideally, I'd rather avoid both.

  But since everyone inevitably grows older,  
  I've always thought it might be interesting  
  to speak of it calmly, like observing something unique.  
  Just as watching a child's innocent charm is fascinating,  
  I feel a slight urge to share what it's like to age.

Yesterday, there was a live comedy show by Sandwich Man at the Ikebukuro Sunshine Theater.  
It was the kind of humor that makes you want to exclaim, "Bravo!"  
I spent the evening impressed, laughing, and marveling at their skill.  
Accompanying me was Mr. Y, a colleague from "Hobo Nichi."

We walked to Ikebukuro Station and caught the Yamanote Line together.  
After letting one packed train pass, we were fortunate to find seats next to each other on the next one.  
Of course, I'm getting on in years, but so is Mr. Y, in his own way.  
From our seats, we glimpsed the view outside through the opposite window.  
Between the old buildings, the western sky occasionally peeked through.  
While it wasn't a particularly breathtaking color,  
the sun was setting in a soft, reddish hue.  
Two older men sitting side by side on the Yamanote Line,  
watching the sun set in the western sky—  
it's not beautiful, but it painted a picture like aged persimmon dye.  
"If we were younger, it would be a completely different scene."  
No, even ten years ago, it would have been a different picture.  
"Chances are, we'll never again ride the Yamanote Line from Ikebukuro,  
seeing a half-hearted sunset through the western window," I remarked.  
Yet, it's not just this moment;  
every "scene of the moment" is never to be repeated.  
Realizing such simple truths is something I couldn't do when I was young.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today.  
It's neither grand nor sad, but today, I've grown a little older.
