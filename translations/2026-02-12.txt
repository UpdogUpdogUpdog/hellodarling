7777: Just Another Ordinary Number  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Lately, whenever I see a four-digit number starting with 1, I can't help but feel an urge to divide it by 360. Funny how the Olympics have influenced even this little quirk of mine.

Numbers, in truth, don't really exist. It sounds a bit like the rambling of a drunken man, but while there are three apples and five bananas, the numbers three and five themselves don't exist. They are simply concepts we agree on. You can create endless numbers, manipulate them by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing, and they serve various purposes. Over time, as numbers have been used among people, they've developed quite distinct personalities.

Numbers like 7777, 3333, and 1111 are the celebrities of the numerical world. Just one digit off, and 7776 loses its star power. Numbers like 9837, 5746, 3895, or 7658 might seem like mundane, common numbers, but in truth, 7777, 3333, and 1111 are no different. Even numbers like 2983 or 1187, when given nicknames like "Nikuya-san" or "Ii-hana," receive a role to play, despite their ordinary appearance. Likewise, 1101 wears the costume of "Itoi."

And so it is with numbers, but also with humans. There are supposedly 8.2 or 8.3 billion of us, and in some fundamental way, we're all the same. Yet, in another sense, each of us is distinctly different.

When it comes to "humans," the basic materials and the way we're made are the same. Our upbringing and how we live, though, are not identical. There are people who are like 777777 or 33333333, but essentially, we're all just like the number 1 at the start, and in the end, we become indistinguishable bones. Among the 8.3 billion "me's," each is the same kind of "human."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Lately, musing over such things has become a bit of a hobby for me—sorry about that.
