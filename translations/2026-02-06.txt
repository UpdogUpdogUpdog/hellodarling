People Don’t Really Listen  
by Shigesato Itoi

・As I was walking through the streets of Shibuya, I thought I saw the words “Mountain Gorilla.” I didn’t bother to verify it and simply kept walking, but it stuck with me. Was it the name of a shop or a brand? It doesn’t really matter, but it feels like the world has run out of new names. Almost as an afterthought, I realized that “Mountain Gorilla” just means “gorilla of the mountains.” So, does that mean there are gorillas that aren’t from the mountains? I guess they would be “Lowland Gorillas.” Lowland, huh? Oh, that’s right—“Lowland Gorilla”! I knew that name. I’d always heard of Mountain Gorillas and Lowland Gorillas, but it never occurred to me that these names referred to their habitats or species. Even though they had politely introduced themselves as mountain or lowland gorillas, I hadn’t really listened.

Come to think of it, even with people’s names, the parents who named them must have imbued each name with their hopes and dreams. Yet, aren’t we all ignoring that, to some extent? Whether it’s Yoshiko, Nozomi, Sho, Kenichi, Tetsu, or Tai, their names are a form of introduction. But we don’t take that seriously, do we? People aren’t really listening to the profound meanings behind names. They just treat them like symbols, like “Yoshiko” or “Tetsu.” But they actually carry messages of “beauty” or “wisdom.”

When I think about it, it’s not just names—people aren’t really listening to anything. If we seriously listened and thought about everything people said, every day would be filled with endless questions and become a hassle. Like when you’re about to have a snack and start wondering, “Why do they call it a shortcake? What exactly is it short compared to? Have I ever seen a long cake?” If you start with questions like that, it gets annoying. Yet, I find myself pondering these kinds of annoying questions all the time, even if I don’t say them out loud.

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun” today. As long as we’re all chatterboxes together, it’s not really a problem, is it?
