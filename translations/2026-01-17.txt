What does it mean to have a flexible mind?  
by Shigesato Itoi

When I first met ・, they talked repeatedly about "plasticity" in the context of the brain. The term "plasticity" typically refers to the ability of materials like clay or plastic to change shape when force is applied and then retain that new shape. It's fascinating to consider this as a crucial property of the brain, and I find myself recalling it often.

In essence, the brain isn't something fixed from birth; it's continuously transformed by experiences, learning, and various environmental changes. The connections between neurons alter, their strengths fluctuate, unused pathways weaken and disappear, while frequently used ones become stronger, faster, and more robust. This dynamic process is happening constantly within the brain—how impressive! We aren't just observing the world; rather, the world is reshaping our brains. If you resonate with this notion, you are likely someone living within this state of "plasticity." We are in a constant state of transformation.

Interestingly, this concept of "plasticity" underscores that the brain is inherently incomplete, unreliable, and fragile, which makes it prone to change. This very imperfection is the essence of its freedom. Reflecting on the old sayings about someone having a "hard head" or a "soft head," it seems their true meaning lies here.

If you consider yourself as constantly "incomplete, unreliable, and fragile," perhaps you become more open to new forces as you encounter fresh environments and experiences. This isn't about being young or old. The capacity for "plasticity" should exist at all times, and probably, to live is to continue evolving.
