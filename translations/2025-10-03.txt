Embarrassment? Well, bring it on.

ãƒ»A car is essentially a moving private room.  
  Inside, you can mumble to yourself all you want,  
  and no one outside will hear you.  
  Crank up your favorite tunes and sing along,  
  and it turns into your personal karaoke booth.  
  Just raise your voice to compensate for the lack of a mic.  
  Sure, people in the car next to you might see you singing your heart out,  
  but whatever, they just see your lips moving.  
  However, if the car windows are open,  
  it's no longer a private room.  
  It's not even a room anymore.  
  It becomes the street, the road. You're out in public.  
  The booming music from the speakers,  
  and more than anything, "my loud voice,"  
  resound into the night city like a lion's roar.  
  Have you ever done something that embarrassing?  
  I have, maybe two or three times.  
  Considering the difference between having the windows fully open or half-open,  
  let's say it counts for about two and a half times.  
  If it's a gentle hum kind of song, you might get away with it,  
  but I'm not one for soft karaoke.  
  If I'm driving alone, it's not "Yesterday" by The Beatles.  
  It's "I Saw Her Standing There."  
  I pick songs by Koji Tamaki or Eikichi Yazawa,  
  the kind where you really belt out the chorus.  
  While driving, with the windows wide open,  
  performing for all the passersby.  
  They're just an audience that I pass in an instant, after all.  
  Still, honestly, it's pretty embarrassing.

  Yet, since I can talk about it like this,  
  it doesn't seem like that big of a deal.  
  I've passed by someone wearing earphones,  
  oblivious to the world around them,  
  even unaware of their own gas as they walked.  
  They were a total stranger, so I couldn't tease them about it.  
  I want to take this as a lesson to be mindful.
