On Getting Bored and Never Getting Bored  
Shigesato Itoi

・I've been gently reminded to steer clear of anything that might sound too risqué, but I think I can share this much. One day, standing at the urinal, a thought struck me: "I'm tired of peeing." Now, if I'm being honest, I'm not really tired of it. It was more a musing on how many times I've done it in my lifetime. People might ponder how many meals they've eaten, but I doubt many wonder how often they've relieved themselves. 

Without thinking of it as tedious, whenever the urge arises, unless something really pressing holds me back, I get up and head to the restroom. Be it rain or shine, no matter where I am, I dutifully prepare for it, do the deed, and return. There's no sense of accomplishment, nor any regret of "I shouldn't have done that." It's neither amusing nor dull, and I simply return to whatever I was doing. 

I've been doing this so naturally for so long, but if I really think about it, I've spent a significant portion of my life on this small task. Could it be that I'm actually bored of it? I wanted to throw this question out there, so I returned to the group and said, "I'm tired of peeing." No one responded with "Come to think of it, I am too," nor did anyone say, "I’m not tired of it." They simply brushed it off as a joke, and that’s okay—it’s the kind of question meant to be brushed aside.

Come to think of it, I'm not tired of eating either. Eating something unappetizing isn’t pleasant, but no one says, "I'm so bored of eating that I won't do it anymore." Well, perhaps someone gravely ill might say that. No one says they're tired of their heart beating or of breathing. When faced with the inability to breathe, people will desperately try to find a way to breathe again. Perhaps those things we do without getting bored are intrinsically tied to life itself.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. So does this mean we can skip the things we've grown tired of doing?
