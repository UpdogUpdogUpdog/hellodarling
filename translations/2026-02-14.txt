Putting on a Brave Face, Embracing My True Self  
by Shigesato Itoi

The announcement about ・ has finally been made.  
It starts with the call for members of the "Manga Club,"  
a message that’s being shared in this form.

I've been quietly telling a few people here and there,  
"Here's what I'm starting."  
Reading their various responses has been a delight.  
What I appreciated most was that  
no one asked those typical press conference questions like,  
"What exactly are you planning to do?"  
We speak a lot about the "Manga Club" within "Hobonichi,"  
but nowhere have we said this is a business venture.  
The priority is to gather members for the "Manga Club."  
Everyone seems to grasp that this is the first step.  
The content of an "expedition" is unknown because it’s an "expedition."  
Once the "expedition team" sets out, that’s when the "exploration" truly begins.  
I find myself reflecting on these things now.  
Knowing "too much already" is the biggest pitfall.  
Being too thorough, overthinking, over-listening, over-preparing—  
I've been careful not to fall into these traps  
while moving forward with the "Hobonichi Manga Club."  
Who wants to do something where everything is predictable?  
We’re not looking for praise like, "How clever you are."

We’ve received a substantial number of applications  
not only from friends and acquaintances,  
but also from people who follow "Hobonichi," even on the first day.  
It’s exciting and nerve-wracking.  
When we started "Hobonichi," it was something that didn’t exist yet,  
and this feels quite similar.

Yet, the thrill of a new beginning, that "thump-thump" feeling,  
can sometimes feel like a "throb-throb" depending on how you perceive it.  
No matter how old I get, there’s a tension like standing under a waterfall.  
Well, perhaps this is what fuels everyone’s energy.  
I might put on a brave face, but I’ll proceed honestly,  
cherishing both my weaknesses and foolishness.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" again today.  
Admitting "this is my true self right now" is actually quite enjoyable.
