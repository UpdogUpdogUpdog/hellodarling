Orders.  
by Shigesato Itoi

・People don't respond to orders.  
　You might protest, "Of course we do; we follow orders all the time,"  
　and sure, I'm aware that happens.  
　There were even times in the past when society ran on orders.  
　In old dramas, you'd often see scenes where someone asks, "Is that an order?"  
　and gets the reply, "Yes, it's an order."  
　These moments depicted a kind of "military discipline,"  
　where people followed orders even if it went against their will.  
　Situations like that haven't vanished entirely.  
　But they are becoming exceedingly rare.

　Fundamentally, people truly don't act on orders.  
　It's better to keep that in mind.  
　Whether concerning ourselves or others,  
　thinking "people don't respond to orders"  
　can help create a better environment, in my opinion.

　If it's not orders that move people, then what is it?  
　There's no single answer.  
　People act on what they love.  
　If there's something they want, they act to obtain it.  
　They'll act for what they believe in or for those they love.  
　They'll act to uphold their virtues or ethics.  
　There are all sorts of reasons.  
　And though it's not an order,  
　sometimes people act under the force of violence.  
　They act because everyone else is doing it, swept along by the tide.  
　Whether directly or indirectly, they act out of fear.  
　Sometimes they act to escape something.  
　Competitiveness with others can be a huge motivator.  
　Even something akin to hypnosis can set them in motion.  
　In short, there are countless reasons why people act.

　Why do I act?  
　What makes me want to move?  
　What drives me to act?  
　If people don't respond to orders, then what compels them?  
　It's not a quiz, but it's worth pondering.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today.  
On this Sunday, we face a cold snap, an election, and various other things.
