A cascade of "I'm glad I watched that" moments.

ãƒ»In 2025, I might find myself watching more movies than usual. I wonder why. Once I think, "I'm glad I watched that," it's easier to feel like watching another film. And then, if that one turns out to be another "I'm glad I watched that," the cycle continues, making me want to watch even more.

Perhaps it all started with "National Treasure." I ended up talking with the director later on, and having watched that three-hour film twice, it kickstarted a movie habit. Watching past works by Director Lee Sang-il on streaming platforms fueled my desire to see even more. I got lucky after that, too. Director Koto Nagata, who I've worked with at "Hobo Nikkan," invited me to a preview of her new film. With a good feeling about it, I went to see "The Fool's Status," and it was captivating. I left in high spirits, thinking, "I'm glad I watched that," and shared some tea with everyone afterward. Among the audience at the preview was a familiar acquaintance who passionately recommended I watch "Journeys and Days," a film she was involved in. Trusting her enthusiasm, I attended the screening shortly after. That film, too, was fascinating. Although the two films had different realms, the passion for their craft was palpable.

In a time when the economy seems sluggish, and people lack energy, and it feels like everything's been done already, there are people who haven't given up or grown tired, pouring their all into creating new masterpieces. This streak of hits was a tremendous joy. I even had the opportunity to have discussions with Directors Koto Nagata and Sho Miyake for "Hobo Nikkan."

Then, even when my health wasn't the best, but my mood was good, Paul T. Anderson's latest work, "One Battle After Another," arrived, alongside his other films like "Magnolia," "There Will Be Blood," and "The Master." I'll sum it up in one line: it was a remarkable display of raw power!

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Lately, I've been continuously impressed by people's expressions in films, manga, and beyond.
