I really wish I could stop pretending to be clever.

・I can’t seem to quit "putting on a clever act."  
  Even if I don't mean to, it just happens naturally.  
  The reason I can't stop is because I'm not even aware I'm doing it.  
  Let me just say upfront, it's easier that way—I do think I've "acted clever" in the past,  
  and, honestly, I often still do.

When people assume you know something with a "surely you're aware of this, right?" attitude,  
it can really stall the conversation if you constantly respond with, "Oh, I'm not familiar with that."  
So, you end up just "pretending like you know."  
Plus, there's the fear of being thought of as foolish.  
But even those who act like they know everything only learned those things at some point;  
there was a time when they didn’t know either.  
Even those who confidently throw around phrases like,  
"Let's align with today's agenda, commit to the KPIs, and maximize synergy!"  
probably added such jargon to their vocabulary bit by bit.  
In situations like that, as for me, I’d likely just stare into space,  
pretending to be lost in deep, profound thought.

And then there's the, "You learned this back in fifth grade, right?" approach—  
assuming everyone knows something because it's "basic education."  
I really wish people would stop saying that.  
Just because it's in the textbook doesn’t mean everyone remembers it!  
Even back in elementary school, nobody scored 100% all the time—  
we couldn't answer everything then, and over time, we've forgotten most of it.  
That's just how people are. We need to have a better understanding of human nature.

Some might argue that this kind of thinking lowers the cultural level,  
or that it makes the population dumber, but that's not true.  
People aren’t foolish at all; they carry a wealth of wisdom, knowledge, and skills.

Thanks for visiting "Hobonichi" again today.  
People who don’t look smart but actually are—that’s really cool.
