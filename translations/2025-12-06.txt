Did Ito Jakuchu ever lay eyes on an elephant?  
Shigesato Itoi

・Elephants were never native to Japan, and those who heard rumors of such creatures must have been absolutely fascinated. Knowledge trickled in from China, so those who were in the know had some idea of their shape and size. Still, when you look at the elephants in Ito Jakuchu's paintings, you get the sense that he was itching to capture them on canvas. It’s clear that the presence of elephants in Edo-period Japan sparked his interest. Back then, many artists eagerly painted exotic animals like lions and mythical creatures like kirins. They must have let their imaginations run wild, having never seen the real thing.

And then I casually searched online and—oh, the wonders of our time—a real elephant actually did exist in Edo-period Japan! During the reign of Tokugawa Yoshimune (in the 13th year of Kyoho), an elephant was gifted from Vietnam. It traveled on foot from Nagasaki to Edo, where it was viewed by many and even had an audience with the shogun and the emperor. I had no idea! We never learned that in social studies. If teachers knew about such tidbits, they’d surely share them with their students. Lessons enriched with such "extras" would be far more engaging and popular.

As laypeople, we often lump together "the past" in a vague blur, mixing up 100,000 years ago with 500 and even 100 years ago. But in truth, each period is vastly different. Personally, I’m quite fond of the topic of "dinosaurs." We know, intellectually, that they roamed the Earth over 200 million years ago, but the concept of "dinosaurs" wasn't born until the 18th century. Before that, no one knew they existed. Fossils were occasionally discovered, but they were often thought to be "dragon bones." Even shell fossils were considered "the devil’s gifts." Perhaps that explanation was simply more satisfying.

Since dinosaurs don't exist in the modern world, we could just as well introduce Godzilla to the Kamakura period. "Minamoto no Yoritomo versus Godzilla"—I think I'd like to see that.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today. If you intentionally forget what you know for a moment, you can have a bit of fun with it.
