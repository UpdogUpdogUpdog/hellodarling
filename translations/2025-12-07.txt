On Feeling Lonely  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Writing about loneliness is a good thing.  
  Like when you step outside on a winter afternoon and—  
  wait, it's already dark.  
  It's something that happens all the time, really.  
  Even as an adult,  
  I find the darkness of evening rather lonely.  
  It was even lonelier when I was a child,  
  and it's something that hasn’t changed with age.  
  I’d love to tell my younger self,  
  "Even when you're old, you'll still feel this way."

As a child, I never told anyone about feeling lonely in the evenings.  
It was a feeling that sometimes made me want to cry,  
a mix of boredom and fear, and an inability to feel cheerful.  
I often felt like that,  
but I didn’t realize it was the loneliness of dusk.  
Even though I had so much fun playing with friends,  
somehow it would all end, and night would begin.  
Hearing voices from other houses as I walked home,  
or the sounds of radios and TVs,  
maybe those were comforting.  
I didn’t know why, but they seemed to offer something,  
a distraction from the loneliness, I suppose.

I’ve said it countless times,  
but the song "Yuki no Furu Machi wo" was hard to bear.  
I wished I didn't have to hear it.  
Looking back now, it was because it made me feel lonely.  
Songs like "Pechka" and "Winter Constellation" were the same.  
Why make so many songs that intentionally evoke loneliness?  
I used to feel a bit resentful about it.  
Yet here I am, writing about loneliness myself,  
because, perhaps, I want to share it with others.  
Everyone has their own fondness for loneliness.  
Even while saying they dislike it, they talk about it.
