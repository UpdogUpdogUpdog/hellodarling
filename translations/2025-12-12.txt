The Joy of Being a Youngster  
Shigesato Itoi

・Without realizing it, I've slipped into the role of the older one wherever I go. Sometimes, I'm even treated like the ancestor of a senior of a senior. But it's fine, really—I still get to enjoy friendly interactions. Still, there was a time when I was the junior, too. Just a kid, inexperienced, a nameless novice at the start of my journey. That version of myself, the young Itoi, is the one I'm most familiar with, where I feel at ease.

Just yesterday in Ogikubo, I had the chance to meet Baron Yoshimoto for the first time. I used to devour his works, serialized in weekly manga magazines for young men. Of course, I was just a greenhorn reader back then. And there he was, the very person who created those manga, still actively thriving. The venue buzzed with his animated conversations and laughter, and I naturally found myself reminiscing about my twenties.

Later that night, there was an event in Shibuya. A gathering of many people connected to Akatsuka-san. I bought a ticket for the evening's "JAZZ Variety" show. It was a big deal, you see. The original Yosuke Yamashita Trio reunited to perform. Yosuke Yamashita on piano, Seiichi Nakamura on saxophone, Takeo Moriyama on drums. It's likely rare for them to even meet each other, let alone perform live together. And to think, they'd all be there playing—what a marvel!

Even their junior counterparts made an appearance, which was a delight. The famous three songs from fifty years ago exploded back to life, steaming with freshness as if newly minted, crashing into the audience. The trio engaged in a musical duel, attacking and counterattacking each other. I was completely transported back to my youthful self. I became that young Itoi again, standing on the sidelines of these incredible giants. The Yosuke Yamashita Trio was phenomenal—absolutely top-notch. We, the audience, were lucky to witness such a night. Grateful to the true stars of the show, I decided not to visit the dressing room and left as my youthful self. At that moment, my 77-year-old and 29-year-old selves coexisted in harmony.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. A significant part of me remains forever a lively junior.
