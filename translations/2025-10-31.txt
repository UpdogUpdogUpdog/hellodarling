Don't worry—just give it a try.

・Today, I'm heading over in advance for tomorrow's α-opening (trial run). The team is working in a place where the heating hasn't been turned on yet, so they keep warning me, "It's going to be cold!" This time of year, with the autumn leaves, the mountains really do get chilly. I'm prepared, but I'm hoping the stove does its job too. As a member of the "Hobo no Eki" team, I've been involved in various aspects, but I'm still a bit confused about which information is public and what remains a surprise. Still, given that only a limited number of people can visit the site, I think it's okay to openly share what I'm looking forward to.

First of all, I'm excited about the relationship between the surrounding environment and "Hobo no Eki." There's a large window facing the sea of clouds—what kind of views will it offer? And when the station-themed exterior and interior start welcoming people, how will the actual image come together? I know the scenery is stunning in every direction, but what role "Hobo no Eki" will play is something we won't understand until it begins. Then, there's the shop, where sample products will be displayed. I haven't seen them all together before. Even though there'll be fewer items than at the official opening, I want to see it with my own eyes. Moreover, the food and drink menu, which has undergone numerous reviews and trials—will the delightful flavors we've decided on be faithfully reproduced and sustained? From what I know, the menu is incredibly delicious. Starting November 1st, it should be available to enjoy—can't wait!

And then there's the possibility that, being in the mountains, no one might come, or on the flip side, there might be unexpected traffic (?). 

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. I sincerely appreciate those who will assist with the trial run on the day.
