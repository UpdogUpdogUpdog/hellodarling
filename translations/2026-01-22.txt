Discovering the Truth  
Shigesato Itoi

・I've had countless conversations with him. Some of these discussions are featured on "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun," and they're also available in our free archive. If you're interested, I highly recommend checking them out.

Yoshimoto is well-known for his extensive writings on Shinran. He's authored a book with us, and among the many figures he's explored—Kenji Miyazawa, Karl Marx, Kunio Yanagita, and others—his work on Shinran stands out. It seems he's spent an especially long time contemplating Shinran. One day, I casually asked him, "Yoshimoto-san, you seem particularly drawn to Shinran. What is it about him that captivates you?" I wasn't really expecting any specific answer, but I did hope for something profound and intriguing.

Yoshimoto-san approaches every question with the same dedication, searching earnestly for the best possible answer. Sometimes, his responses might seem like they're taking the scenic route, but those detours often enrich the question itself. My question was essentially, "Why do you like Shinran so much?" As always, Yoshimoto-san nodded a few times, as if confirming the question, and then began to speak. "Well... my parents were from Amakusa, a place with a strong Jodo Shinshu Buddhist faith. My grandmother was a devout believer. I remember that well. Perhaps that had an influence," he said. So, it all started with being raised in a Jodo Shinshu household. How ordinary! (laughs) It was such a simple answer, yet it felt like I had heard the most genuine truth. Yoshimoto Ryumei had thought deeply about Shinran, but it all began with "growing up in a Shinshu family with a Buddhist altar." Finding the real, honest truth seems to become easier as you age.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. What's at the core of everything? Sometimes we look, but we still can't see.
