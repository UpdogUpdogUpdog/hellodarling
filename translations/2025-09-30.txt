Is this what it means to be truly cool?

ãƒ»In all sorts of situations, Shohei Ohtani is seen as someone extraordinary. Major League players and insiders alike refer to him as a "unicorn." They're comparing him to a miraculous creature. Over time, this kind of praise has become expected, and the initial "astonishment" seems to have faded. It's as if what he does is just natural now. But it really shouldn't be, should it?

This year, as if it were the most natural thing, he excelled once again. He outperformed everyone and contributed significantly to the Dodgers' championship win. It's widely believed he'll be this season's MVP. By September 26, he had hit 54 home runs, matching last year's total, closing in just two shy of Schwarber, who was leading in that category. With two games left, many fans, myself included, anticipated that Ohtani would hit those two home runs and seize the title. On September 28, in a crucial game, everyone's eyes were on whether Shohei Ohtani would hit a home run that day. But OHTANI's name was absent from the lineup. Due to team circumstances, Edman was chosen as the designated hitter, and Ohtani sat out. This decision reduced his chances by four or five opportunities to swing for the title. As a mere fan, I was struck by what a bold decision it was. Perhaps this was the choice the team needed to make to prepare for the intense battles of the upcoming playoffs. However, the opportunity to become "home run king" was almost entirely lost. According to reports, Shohei Ohtani told Manager Roberts, "It's your decision." The word "genuine" came to mind. I felt like I learned what a great player considers. No matter how prestigious the MLB home run title might be, the reality of the decision made was overwhelmingly richer. In the Dodgers' final game the next day, Shohei Ohtani hit his 55th home run. He was just one short of being the home run king, but 55 was his personal best record.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. It's a bit too far-fetched to even wonder, "What would I have done in his shoes?"
