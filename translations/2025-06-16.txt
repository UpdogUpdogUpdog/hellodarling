Gone, but Never Empty  
By Shigesato Itoi

・People pass away.  
Those who were close to us, those we knew well, they too leave us. Even people from distant lands, whose names we recognize, or whose works we've appreciated, their passing tugs at our hearts, leaving us with a sense of loss.

Today, the news came that Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys has passed. People of a certain generation, those who cherished that particular flavor of music, they know him. Words of tribute flow through the news channels, spoken by people of great renown, people who have themselves aged.

In my world, too, the number of people passing has grown. The seniors I occasionally meet joke, "Everyone around me is leaving," but it’s usually followed by a softer admission, "It gets lonely." As I listen, I realize I’m just a step behind them in line.

When someone passes away, it's as if the world dents in the shape of their absence. That’s how I see it. A person leaves, and their absence carves a gap. Over time, this "dent in the world" fills back in. With other amusements, chores, or just the passage of air, the void gradually closes. This happens when memories fade, and that’s when the departed truly vanish.

However, when the living gather to share memories of those who have gone, they create a space where the departed linger. Many pass away, and while it's a commonplace occurrence, forgetting is natural. When it's our turn to go, everything will be forgotten anyway. I write these thoughts in the middle of the night, spooning yogurt in the dim light.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today.  
"To die" is entwined with the end of "to live."
