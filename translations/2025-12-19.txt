Déjà vu

・When it comes to potato chips, I usually start by deciding, “Maybe not right now,” and push the thought aside. But then, almost immediately, I think, “Oh, just a little bit,” and open the bag just a tiny bit, taking out about a sixth of the contents. I end up eating just one chip, almost as an afterthought. “Hey, this is really good!” I find myself thinking, my previously closed-off heart starting to open up.

Of course, I fold the bag many times over, sealing it tight with something like a clip to keep it from getting stale, or so I tell myself. I start eating the chips I poured out, one by one, marveling at how the initial deliciousness lingers. Each chip tastes just as good as the last. This wasn’t supposed to happen, but before I know it, they’re almost all gone.

“Well, what can you do?” I say, as I open the supposedly sealed bag again and decide to take out about half of what’s left. I tell myself that’s it, I won’t eat any more, and seal the bag again, even though the contents are now less than half of what they were at first. Determined, I quickly finish the portion I took out. I’m not tired of them at all—they’re still irresistibly good. They gradually dwindle away until they’re gone.

“Potato chips really are something special,” I say to myself, as if I’ve just made a groundbreaking discovery. I’m almost at the point of no return. …I take a break.

Am I going to keep doing this, over and over, forever? Feeling a bit pathetic, I get annoyed with myself for being so petty, so small-minded. I gather my courage, telling myself I’m a sailor, a real man. Once again, I open the sealed bag, and in a moment of defiance, I decide not just half this time!

“Empty it all out!” I shout silently, triumphantly. Of course, it’s a silent shout—quiet and calm. The bag is emptied and tossed into the trash. The clip goes back in the drawer. It almost feels like none of it ever happened.

All the chips, consumed, chewed, and swallowed. “Once again, I’ve let it come to this…” I think. I decide to jot this down, to let others read it, and so, I write.

Thank you for visiting “Almost Daily” today. Without scolding or laughing at myself, I stare at the ceiling.
