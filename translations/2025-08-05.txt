Memories accumulate in the everyday lives of people.  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Every day, I see something new.  
The sky I looked up to yesterday, marveling at how clear it was, is a sky I had never seen before. It may resemble skies from days gone by, but it is unique to that day alone. In truth, even the reflection of myself brushing my teeth in the mirror is a version of me I've never met before—me, for today only. Perhaps it's worth capturing that in a photo. A year later, when I see that face, I'll likely think how young I looked. In this way, even the most mundane days are layered with memories unique to that moment. If I have a little argument with someone close, that's a memory bound to that moment, and it's something I choose to cherish.

However, it's true that memories with clear meaning are easier to recall. For instance, last night I watched a film called "The Pope's Election." It was truly fascinating, and I spent two captivating hours engrossed in it. The phrase "Certainty is the greatest enemy of tolerance" left a strong impression on me. This, too, becomes an easily accessible memory. The filmmakers likely intended it to be treated as a significant expression.

Lately, I've been meeting Tadanori Yokoo quite often. In some ways, Yokoo remains consistent in his posture and words. Yet, with subtle, almost imperceptible changes, he remains fresh. His neck had been in pain for a long time, resistant to treatment from hospitals, massages, acupuncture, or hot springs. But one day, while cycling in direct sunlight, he felt the warmth easing his discomfort. Wrapping a towel around his neck, he found relief. He shared this story, pain-free, with the towel still around his neck. This, too, is a memory for both me and Yokoo. These various memories shape who I am.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Yes, I've come to understand—living is all about memories.
