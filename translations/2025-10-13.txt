At my place, there's someone incredibly adorable, you know.

・Every single day, I'm writing something or other. You might think by now I've covered just about everything, but that's not quite true. Maybe there are more things I haven't written about yet. The things I can't quite put into words so they remain unsaid. Thoughts I have but don't wish to share with anyone else. Things that might touch on someone else's secret. Matters so personal that I’d rather leave them untouched. Those things I haven't written about, and probably never will. Yet, there are still those things that, despite not being written down or noted anywhere, linger in my heart. Small things that somehow leave a big impression.

I think my daughter is probably less prone to anger than I am. Not that she's some paragon of virtue, just that she doesn't get angry easily. Generally speaking, she's of a gentle disposition, but there was a time she got mad at some old guy. I've forgotten the details, but she was genuinely upset. "So, did you talk back?" I asked her. "I held it in and stayed quiet," she replied. Then she added, "But I thought to myself, 'At my place, there's someone incredibly adorable, you know.'" This was shortly after her daughter was born. "At my place, there's someone incredibly adorable"—it's hard to explain, but it seems to give her immense confidence, or maybe a profound sense of pride. It must be a kind of power that lets her stand up against all the world's malice. I wish I could say something as wonderfully inexplicable as that.

"Even gold and silver and jewels, what are they to me compared to the treasure that is my child?" That's Yamanoue no Okura. I understand that sentiment, but the raw, specific cry of "At my place, there's someone incredibly adorable" from a "newly minted mother" resonates deeply with me, and I remember it vividly. The person who said it might have forgotten, and of course, the baby knows nothing of it.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" today. I wish for the happiness of every child as fervently as I wish for world peace.
