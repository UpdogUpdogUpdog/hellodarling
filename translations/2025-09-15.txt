Team Building the Momotaro Way  
by Shigesato Itoi

Right now, both for myself and for "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun," I'm planning to embark on something new. It's a whirlwind of activity—starting this, preparing that, meeting with people, studying and consulting here and there—but it's all quite enjoyable. Naturally, we think and discuss things like, "We need someone with this role on our team." Just like in sports, there are positions to fill, right? But lately, I've been questioning this approach. Is it really the best idea to assemble a team strictly based on roles?

When you're about to dive into something with "infinite possibilities," doesn't having predetermined roles, numbers, and organizational structures risk boxing you in? Instead, maybe we should focus on finding people who can do unique things or are exceptionally skilled in certain areas. But what if, rather than ensuring every position is filled, we just gather those we genuinely want to work with, even if some roles remain vacant? Then, as we collaborate, we can identify and fill in the missing pieces together.

Think about it: when Momotaro set off to defeat the demons, did he first determine the necessary roles and then recruit the dog, monkey, and pheasant accordingly? No, he found the dog, the monkey, and the pheasant, and they chose to join him. From there, they figured out how to fight. If that story were a longer epic, they might have discussed recruiting an elephant or persuading a thunder god to join their side. It's entirely plausible that key pieces of the puzzle get decided later on.

Incidentally, we've already tried something similar at "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun." We once held a recruitment drive that invited people who wanted to do certain things with us to join. Those who came aboard then are now thriving. If I recall correctly, we ended up hiring about three times more people than originally planned.
