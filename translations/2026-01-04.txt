Doing It Myself  
Shigesato Itoi

・There's no break for holidays—no Bon Festival, no New Year's—for those who are truly driven.  
  Now, I'm not just talking about Michiko Shimizu here, though she certainly counts among the many who get things done.

  Everything I watch, read, and discover—not just soups but knowledge—makes me think, "Wow, they're really doing it." Maybe it's because I'm on a break, not caught up in work, that I'm more attuned to all the things people are accomplishing. There are endless shows I missed that are fascinating. So many books that would captivate me, still unread. And even now, someone out there is creating, doing something remarkable. In this very moment, they're pushing forward. It's truly incredible, and it makes me want to do something too. When I was younger, I mistook this feeling for jealousy, but it's not that. It's more like a challenge being thrown down.

  Somehow, both I and the world around me have shifted to being more about observing than doing. That's true, isn't it? Even as a baseball fan, I'm just watching the games, getting emotionally invested in the players' efforts. It's become a pattern—appreciating the doers, supporting them, turning their efforts into competition for our entertainment. It's like the relationship between racehorses and the people betting on them. We make predictions, offer critiques, but we're not the ones running, neither horse nor jockey.

  I think idols are truly amazing too. It’s worth asking, even if it’s pointless, whether I could do what they do if I were good-looking. But in reality, there are always those who are actually doing it.

  Where and what should I be doing as a doer? As we enter the New Year, it's worth pondering whether I can stand among the dancers. Enjoying the view is fine, of course, but I want to be doing something myself, to be a doer.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today.  
As Eikichi Yazawa once said, "The ones who do it, do it."
