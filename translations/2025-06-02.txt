Translation:
Clean up your act and eat a bowl of rice! (1)

Every day, the topic of rice is always being discussed. Even I, myself, have become more aware of it than I thought, and I've been checking out the rice sections in various stores. The image of rice that I've had since I was young has changed, and I've started to think, "This is different from before." It was when I saw the menu board at a nearby Chinese restaurant that I really started to think seriously about it. The restaurant is a typical Chinese place in town, with ramen for 800 yen and chahan for 900 yen. Below that, it said "Rice 400 yen." I've been alive for a long time, so I know that the price of rice has been changing gradually, but I never thought it would reach 400 yen. I'm not trying to say it's good or bad, but 400 yen?

On TV news programs, they're discussing the retail price of rice, which seems to be around 5 kilograms per unit. It's said that the price has exceeded 4,000 yen, which is not only high but also means that there's a shortage of rice. Now, they're talking about releasing stockpiled rice into the market to bring the price down to around 2,000 yen. The unit of conversation is always 5 kilograms. If 5 kilograms cost 4,000 yen, and 5 kilograms cost 2,000 yen, then how much would a bowl of rice cost? I couldn't figure it out at all, so I ended up doing the calculation in the middle of the night.

First, a bowl of rice is about 150 grams, which is the weight of cooked rice. That's equivalent to 65 grams of uncooked rice. One kilogram of rice can make about 15 bowls of rice. So, if 5 kilograms of rice costs 4,000 yen, then one bowl of rice would cost around 53 yen. If it costs 2,000 yen, then one bowl of rice would be around 27 yen. I won't say whether that's expensive or cheap.

It takes water, fire, and effort to cook dry white rice, but the price of rice is high at 53 yen per bowl, or low at 27 yen. When eating at home, you can have a refill and still feel like you're paying around 100 yen. 

Thanks for coming to "Almost Daily" today. I was just talking about the calories in rice the other day, wasn't I?
