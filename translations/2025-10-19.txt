"Getting bored" isn't a sin. It's like "death" in that way.  
- Shigesato Itoi

The word "boredom" is usually used in a negative context. It's often considered better to remain "unbored" if possible. There's even a saying: "business without boredom." If you can keep doing something without getting bored, success is likely to follow. I share this sentiment.

Yet, truth be told, I get bored easily. Even with things I start excitedly or enjoy doing, I eventually find myself getting bored. It feels like a rude trait, making me feel guilty, and I've long pondered how to fix this fickle nature. Nonetheless, when boredom hits, it hits. And when something can't be stopped despite boredom, we find ways to keep going. This can be quite tough.

The fact that I've pondered boredom so extensively might mean I'm not bored of it. Reluctantly, I've continued to think about it. Pondering boredom also means considering how we become boring to others. No matter the job or life we lead, both boredom and becoming boring have been abundant. Even if you plead with someone, "Don't get bored of me," they'll eventually do so. Just as I get bored, so do others.

Living long enough has taught me that it's impossible to never get bored. Humans get boredâ€”it's simply in our nature. Once I understood this, I began to center my thoughts around boredom. Just as death inevitably comes, so does boredom. Recognizing when boredom is approaching before it fully arrives becomes crucial. At that point, there's a chance to avoid it. If you can find ways to sidestep boredom creatively, you're fortunate. Haven't I been doing just that all along? And when you're truly bored, what then? Either quit or pass it on to someone else. If you don't view boredom negatively, these options become possible. So everyone, let's say it together: "Humans get bored!"
