Persistent Pursuit of Ideas  
Shigesato Itoi

・How many times have I said, "It's all about the idea"? Countless times, really. When I'm alone and I encounter some form of expression, I often find myself thinking, "Ah, this is an idea," feeling both impressed and frustrated. It's happened thousands of times, and I don't think I'm exaggerating. So, before anyone—be it a newcomer or a mid-level* person—asks me how ideas are born or when they come to me, I've already spent a lot of time worrying and pondering over it myself. Yet, it remains elusive. If the process were simply "building up," that might be fine, but the truth is, ideas require a leap.

The other day, when I met with Shigeru Miyamoto for the first time in a while, our conversation naturally turned, as it often does, to ideas. "Most ideas come while talking with others, don't they?" he said. In other words, they don't usually emerge when you're stewing by yourself, but rather when you're engaged with someone else.

Ideas can arise as "advice" during someone else's meandering, or to remove an unexpected "obstacle" you stumble upon, or even when you're bored with a dull conversation and your mind wanders. Ideas aren't usually gifts from above; they're more like four-leaf clovers at your feet. It's rare for ideas to spring from tension. Indeed, it's the "slack" that follows focus and tension, the playful deviation from the goal, that creates a gap where ideas can slip in. "When I'm alone, it's usually in the bath," I find myself saying. It's hard to "focus" in the bath, after all. You could say you soak in the bath to invite "slack." "Plus, your blood circulation improves," and that's true. But if you start thinking you can just take a bath to come up with ideas, that conscious effort ruins it.

...Well, I understand up to this point. Perhaps the first premise is to have an interest in ideas?

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Noticing "the absence of an idea" might be the first step.
