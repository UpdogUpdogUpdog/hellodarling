Everyone loves a good story about "love."

Shigesato Itoi

Come to think of it, there were adults I looked up to and thought, "I wish I could be like them." When asked, "Who do you admire?" I probably answered with something like "President Kennedy" without much thought. But in truth, there were plenty of people I genuinely wanted to emulate.

Sometimes, those people were my teachers. I was fortunate to have several teachers I adored. For instance, a teacher who spoke with genuine joy about their favorite novels or movies was enough to make me think, "That's wonderful." And when that teacher talked about someone they admired, it was even better. Whether it was a historical figure or just someone they knew, hearing them praise that person was delightful. Even if it wasn’t a teacher but a classmate who loved pop songs and sang with genuine enjoyment during a bus trip, I found myself thinking, "That's great."

When someone truly loves something, it's probably good in some way. There must be something "good" that they've discovered. I find myself wanting to experience that "goodness," eager to hear more about it. Sometimes, I even end up trying it myself, whether tasting it or buying it.

When someone talks passionately about "people or things they love," children—like the old me—can't help but think, "I want to be like that." And probably, I too became someone who seeks out and talks about "people and things I love."

I couldn't imagine wanting to be like someone who always found fault in things or criticized others. But I did admire people who stayed cheerful despite difficulties, those who seemed unfazed, or who were just kind in some way. I believe people naturally gravitate toward what they admire.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Kids, let the adults tell you about the things they love.
