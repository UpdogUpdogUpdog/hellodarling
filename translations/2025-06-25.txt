Again and again, endlessly, what is "interesting"?

Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»The other day, Sugano from "Hobo Nikkan" asked me, "What do you think makes something interesting?" The fact that she felt compelled to ask such a question is itself a good sign. She wasn't casually posing a difficult question; it's something she's been pondering repeatedly. That sense of genuine curiosity makes me want to respond sincerely. Apparently, I answered, "Observation... maybe." I don't actually remember saying that, but it works for me. "Observation... maybe" is as good an answer to "What makes something interesting?" as any. I think it's enough, well said, me. And Sugano, who asked the question, seemed to understand it well.

Yet, I'm sure both she and I are still mulling over "What is interesting?" It feels like stopping this train of thought might offer some relief, but I don't want to stop, and I keep thinking because I still don't know. For ages, people have returned to this question. Some have answered, "It's tension and release." That seemed plausible, but it never settled the matter for me.

The idea of "observation... maybe" can be further explored. People who are good at mimicry are good observers, right? They can recreate what they observe. The same goes for sketching in art. Even if you can draw a detailed sketch, that alone doesn't make it interesting. Conversely, even when observation is incomplete and the recreation isn't perfect, there are things that make you think, "That's nice" or "That's interesting." The sentiment of "It's clumsy but really great" is quite common. When it comes to what's interesting, it seems to be about revealing the "observer's perspective" on what they have observed. This unique perspective, when combined, manifests as "critique." That critique might be the core of what makes something interesting. I can get lost in thinking about this endlessly. But, for now, perhaps "observation" is a good enough answer. Generally, people don't observe properly. They stop observing and rely on patterns. Observation is something even babies, dogs, and cats can do.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. Also, people who find things interesting are themselves interesting. That might be another way to look at it.
