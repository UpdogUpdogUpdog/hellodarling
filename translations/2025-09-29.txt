Whether You Know It or Not  
by Shigesato Itoi

・Now then, where did I first encounter the phrase "silent return home"? It's not as if I set out to learn it; I stumbled upon it by chance. I don't mean to boast, but there are many things I don't know. And I'm aware of people who know even less than I do. Each of us, at some point along our life’s journey, encounters new knowledge or wisdom and comes to understand it. Sometimes, we grasp things that are beyond words—an indescribable knack, a posture, or an attitude. There are things we learn only to forget, and things we forget repeatedly. That's just the way it is.

When the opportunity to learn arises, we learn. With the desire to know, one can learn a great deal. There are many things we know that we don't need to, and things we really should know but don't. Yet, those things we haven't crossed paths with in our life’s journey are inevitably unknown to us.

I think it's best not to boast or criticize too much about what we do or don't know. Similarly, I feel the same way about reading books. Books are undoubtedly wonderful—they enrich us and teach us many things. But whether someone reads books is determined by the path they've walked in life. Some lives never intersect with reading, while others are filled with nothing but books. Neither is something to boast about or be blamed for. I neither praise avid readers nor criticize those who don't read. It's just like knowing and not knowing.

I wonder if a book themed around "things we think we know but don't" would sell if revised and published annually.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. This was written by Itoi, who used to misread "市井" as "ichii."
