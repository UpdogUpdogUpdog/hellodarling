A Tapestry of Memories  
Shigesato Itoi

・When I was young, I rarely shared my memories.  
I suppose I was trying to seem cool.  
I believed it was better to discuss what lay ahead  
than to endlessly recount the past with excitement.  
Perhaps, I genuinely felt that way.

Maybe I just couldn't find anything worth retelling as a memory.  
I must have been young.  
The past often feels a bit foolish or lacking compared to the present,  
so perhaps it didn't fill me with pride.

In any case, I used to think of memories as something much more trivial.  
Recounting a time when I went somewhere, who was there,  
and all the silly conversations we had—  
I found it all rather dull.  
Things easily forgotten, too insignificant to count as memories.  
That’s what I must have thought back then.

Yet, as I kept living through the years,  
I started to feel that most things aren’t so bad after all.  
I even began to see them as endearing, or even charming.  
It’s a huge transformation.  
Not just the joyful moments, but also the unpleasant ones,  
the hardships, the times I felt down, the emotions I loathed—  
surprisingly, they’re not so easily forgotten.  
Each of these is what we call a memory.  
Today, I feel like a tapestry of memories.  
Shadows should remain as shadows,  
and we should rejoice in the brilliance of light where it exists.  
Even the seemingly dull, unremarkable memories  
are all woven together into patterns.  
This is me, the essence of who I am.  
We are collections of memories, and we,  
dream of today and tomorrow.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today.  
Finally, I'm heading there myself. I've always been envious.
