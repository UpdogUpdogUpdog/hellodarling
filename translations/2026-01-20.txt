Natto, Here I Come!  
Shigesato Itoi

・As the personal motto of baseball player Hideki Matsui goes,  
"When the heart changes, actions change.  
When actions change, habits change.  
When habits change, character changes.  
When character changes, destiny changes."  
This phrase is attributed to his mentor, Coach Tomoshige Yamashita, from his days at Seiryo High School  
(though there are various theories about its origin, which are unclear to me).  
It's an impeccably crafted statement.  
The most crucial part is probably the initial "when the heart changes."  
I think this is what the phrase wants to emphasize as the "starting point."  
A theme meant to be whispered to "you" or perhaps "yourself."  
And then it flows naturally into "if the heart changes, surely actions will follow."  
It's perfectly fine if it just makes you think, "That might be true."  
The challenge comes with the next part.  
"When actions change, habits change!"—this is the big leap.  
Whether actions truly transform into habits is the critical issue.  
There can be actions that never quite become habits.  
This line, in essence, is urging, "Make it a habit!"

Once "actions" turn into "habits,"  
they can be recognized as part of your "character" by those around you.  
And that kind of "character" might even shift your "destiny" for the better.  
But by then, it's like saying, "You will find happiness."  
The heart of it all is that "habits" are incredible!

Well, for instance, writing "Hobo Nikkan"** every day for 27 years,  
or measuring my weight every morning and night for probably over 20 years—  
it seems I've managed to cultivate "habits" quite well.  
As for "character" and "destiny," I'm not quite sure.  
But I've got a solid track record of turning "actions" into "habits."  
...And everything above was just a preamble.

Right now! I'm trying to change my heart with the thought,  
"If natto is so full of benefits, then I'll eat it every day."

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today.  
I am telling my heart that natto is a "supplement called natto."
