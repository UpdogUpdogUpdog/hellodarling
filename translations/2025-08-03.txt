I really liked the summer heat of the Showa era.

No matter how much you complain about the heat, it won't cool things down. In fact, all that "It's so hot, it's so hot" chatter just seems to make the air around you even steamier. It's like being in a noisy place—everyone shouting "It's so noisy!" just makes it worse. So I decided to avoid saying it as much as possible.

I’ve always considered myself more vulnerable to the cold than the heat. Since I was a kid, I've preferred summer; it was always easier to handle. But the summers I knew back then were nothing like what we have now. In my school days, any gym class would switch to swimming once the temperature hit 25 degrees Celsius. Nowadays, that's a temperature you'd set your air conditioner to for comfort. For someone like me, who’s a bit sensitive to the cold, a 25-degree day at the pool felt chilly, the water even colder. I wouldn’t have minded if class got canceled, but since my classmates were all eager for pool time, I'd pretend to be excited too. In truth, I preferred it to be around 28 degrees, and 30 degrees was even better—perfect, really. People would complain about the heat, but back then, the summer heat was just part of life, nothing to dread.

But now, look at July and August—the average temperature is almost 30 degrees! This is a completely different summer, not the ones we had in the Showa or Heisei eras. Forcing high school baseball games to go on in this heat feels like punishment. These summers aren't the same; you can't just tough them out. Even wild savanna animals spend their days napping in the shade. Both predator and prey take a break. This isn’t just a "let's implement daylight saving time" level of heat. It's become necessary to rethink outdoor activities entirely. I wonder if people will start living more in their heads, retreating indoors during the day and coming out only at night. But even as we ponder these changes, autumn will sneak up on us...

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" again today.  
The problem is, because autumn comes around naturally, we never really address the issue, do we?
