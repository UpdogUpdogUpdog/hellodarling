The Courage to Start Your Own Shop  
Shigesato Itoi  

・Take udon, for example. There are plenty of people who love it. Some even go from place to place just to taste different kinds of udon. They listen to others' opinions, search online, and become quite knowledgeable about udon. There are so many types of broth, right? Is it made with kombu, bonito, or something else? What kind of soy sauce should you choose—dark or light? And then there's the noodle itself—how thick should it be? Should it be soft, firm, chewy, or fluffy? What about the type of wheat or the blend? Should it be served hot, cold, kamaage, or something else? And don't forget about the toppings—aburaage, tempura, eggs. Even someone like me, who wouldn't claim to be an udon expert, can think of this much.

People have plenty to say about udon. They might comment on whether a certain shop's udon is delicious or if another's has lost its flavor, whether the prices are high or low, or if the service is good or bad. From regular udon enthusiasts to self-proclaimed or recognized udon critics, everyone has something to say about udon. However, when those "super knowledgeable about udon" folks or "udon lovers" decide to open their own udon shop, it's not enough to just say, "This is tasty, and so is that." They have to decide on one thing: "This is our udon" and present it to their customers. Anyone can talk endlessly about what makes this or that udon special at various shops across the country. But unless you decide, "This is my udon," you can't open an udon shop. The courage to declare, "This is it. I've decided on this," is something that just talking about it doesn't require.

Though I've used an udon shop as an example, it applies to anything—it takes courage. Starting your own shop is a bundle of "courage."
