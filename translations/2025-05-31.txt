"Maybe that's something AI couldn't do." 
Love has been replaced with AI, causing problems. 
Is AI capable of going that far? 
Can AI do such a thing? 
Since it's an unprecedented experience, 
we're bewildered by AI. 
Artificial Intelligence, which multiplies the possibilities it can think of, 
proposes what it deems most suitable after calculating them. 
I view it as something like that. 
The original information for AI's thinking is 
all the information buried on the internet, 
and it's even better if more is added. 
Right now, new information is being added to AI, 
new methods are being tried, and new answers are being born. 
No human can do such a thing. 
If we call this "being intelligent," 
humans have already been surpassed by AI, 
and the gap is growing wider by the minute. 
But I think... 
If the latest AI were transported to ancient Egypt, 
would it propose building a pyramid-like structure? 
If AI existed in 8th-century Japan (which it didn't!), 
would it say, "Let's build the Great Buddha of Nara, like this"? 
If AI appeared before a young John Lennon, 
would it say, "Let's create something like the Beatles"? 
"Would you like a song like this?" and create one? 
If AI were transported to me in 1997, 
would it teach me, "You'll have a day like this. The content will be like this and that"? 
While it's possible for AI to greatly help us with various tasks 
and explore many possibilities, 
I don't think it can think about weird things. 
There are still many things I don't understand about AI. 
Thank you for coming to "Almost Daily" today. 
Gently, strongly, and interestingly, that's how AI is, I suppose.
