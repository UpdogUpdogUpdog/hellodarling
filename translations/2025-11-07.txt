・Every day, the drafts I write here follow a rule: 27 characters per line, 40 lines total (though this format doesn't apply on smartphones). On my computer, the text displays in this style, and I write with that in mind.

I came up with the rule of wrapping lines at 27 characters. Handwritten manuscript paper typically accommodates 20 characters per line, 20 lines per page. Manuscripts are counted in these 400-character units. Back when I still worked by hand, I used this 400-character paper too. But as a copywriter, I found it inconvenient for crafting catchphrases or short sentences. So, I created a 200-character version: 20 characters per line, 10 lines total. I stuck with this style for a long time, but once I transitioned to typing drafts and publishing them directly online, something felt off. A 20-character line breaks longer sentences too quickly. On the other hand, 30 characters per line feels too long. After some experimentation, I settled on 27 characters per line. I also decided to standardize the daily writing volume. Leaving the length open-ended proves troublesome in its own way. Having a set "rule" allows me to fend off critiques about "quality." If it’s too long, people might not read it; if too short, they might think I’m slacking off (laughs). Two pages of manuscript paper seemed manageable, so I committed to writing 40 lines every day.

However, as more people started reading on smartphones, these rules began to feel somewhat outdated. At this point, since I’m writing daily anyway, why not have days where just "one line" suffices? This idea struck me suddenly, and I wrote "just one line" first, but I ended up, as usual, justifying it in the familiar format.
