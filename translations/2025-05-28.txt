About Not Becoming Better

Ah, I thought it was that kind of thing. 
When I was young, I believed that if I continued doing something, 
my skills would improve, and I would become better and better, vaguely thinking so.
However, reality is not like that. 
In the world of sports, it's easy to understand.
There are athletes who are at their peak in their youth, 
but some people continue to grow technically and thrive in their 30s and 40s.
When I think about the art world, the story becomes more complicated.
One's perspective on things might improve. 
Fine techniques can also be acquired.
However, unlike sports, where muscle and nerve deterioration directly affect performance, 
it's not necessarily true that one becomes better with age. 
This is true for music, painting, writing, and acting as well.
One might develop a refined sense or depth, 
but it's not a matter of continuously becoming better and reaching that point.
Even if a refined sense or depth emerges, 
it's not as if one has become better and reached that point.
It's not like the world of rakugo (Japanese storytelling), where 
even someone like Kōyūji Shinbashi, who was still good in his later years, 
eventually became too old and couldn't be heard anymore (though that's not necessarily bad).

Most things, in terms of skill, will eventually decline.
There's also the mindset of "what's the point of becoming better?"
"Becoming better" is a significant value in the process of improvement, 
but it's also a question of "so what?"
Becoming better, or the idea of becoming better, 
eventually stagnates and declines somewhere.
Ah, personally speaking, as for writing, 
I've never thought I've become better at it.
Thank you for the "almost daily" visits. 
Even if I'm not good, I can still create something interesting. It's amusing.
