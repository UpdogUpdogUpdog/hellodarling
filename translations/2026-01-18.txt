Just the Kuzumochi Itself.  
Shigesato Itoi

・In the Kanto region, the "kuzumochi" dessert is made from wheat starch, resulting in a white, opaque, jiggly, and slightly chewy treat. The same "kuzumochi" name is used, but in Kansai, it's different. There, it's made by kneading kudzu starch into a transparent, jiggly form. Of course, I love both types! But I'm not here to talk about my favorite foods. The thing is, neither type of "kuzumochi" is eaten on its own. If someone were to present it to you and say, "Please, help yourself," no one would just say, "Alright, I'll dig in," and eat it plain. You eat it by pouring kuromitsu syrup or dusting it with kinako powder (the kudzu version might even be wrapped around sweet bean paste as a sort of manju). People who claim to love or crave "kuzumochi" are actually fans of "kuzumochi flavored with kuromitsu." Most of the delicious taste comes from the syrup. Yet, even those people don't just drink the syrup by itself. So, I think it's fair to say they truly do like "kuzumochi."

I'm going to persist with a similar point. Anmitsu and mitsumame are essentially jelly treats made from agar. However, as you know, it's unlikely anyone would eat just the plain agar. You pour kuromitsu or white syrup over it, maybe even add some anko. Still, anmitsu and mitsumame are considered jelly-based snacks. By the way, imagine a strawberry shortcake without a strawberry on top, even if it's just a halved one. This is a bit different from the case with "kuzumochi" or jelly, though.

Even if the main component, the central theme, and the name of the dish is "kuzumochi," without the kuromitsu (and kinako, too), "most people wouldn't really eat it." "Kuzumochi" exists because people enjoy eating it, not just to define what "kuzumochi" is.

Often, when completing some project, we end up presenting "kuzumochi" without the syrup. This was the sort of thing we were discussing internally, and today, I've written just one extra line than usual.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" again today. Remember, it’s all about people connecting with people. Don't forget the kuromitsu or the strawberries.
