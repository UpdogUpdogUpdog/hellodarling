I'm thinking about writing something like a fart.
I've been inspired.
In the piece I always read,
Okuno-san's writing had an explosive power, much like a fart.
I've wanted to write something like a fart for ages.
But I can't really remember ever doing so.
Even though I truly want to write about farts,
I haven't actually done it, have I?
Here I am, having written daily articles for "Almost Daily,"
living my life without ever jotting down a word about farts.
And then, my junior, Okuno-san, swoops in and does it effortlessly.

Perhaps it was a real-life story that inspired the piece.
A tale that unfolded close to Okuno-san's usual interests.
In the beginning, it had an intellectual style, more tense than usual.
It narrated the chance discovery of a photo exhibition.
The quiet of the exhibition hall, and an elderly gentleman who was the only other person there.
And then. Unbelievably, the tension reached its peak and exploded.
From there, I won't say more.
It didn't just end with the climax and a lingering aftertaste.
The story moved on to another photo exhibition.
A 2013 exhibition held in a depopulated village.
How far will the reader be led astray?
The imagery spun in dizzying spirals, enough to unsettle one's sense of balance,
and I found myself absorbed in Okuno-san's exploration of farts and art,
looking up at the ceiling, feeling like I had spent my time well.

I wanted to write about farts too.
Anything will do; now is the time to write about farts.
Not that I wish to compete with Okuno-san's magnificent fart piece,
but what kind of fart could I possibly create?
Whatever, I'll just put down a line that has neither sound nor scent, not even a fart,
and call it a day.

"I have farted before" is
probably a true statement, but I can't say it's entirely honest.
I must have done it far more than that.

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today.
"Toyotomi Brothers!" is interesting and charmingly nostalgic.
