What's Next After Being "Proficient"?  
by Shigesato Itoi

・If you’ve been following "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" for a while, you’re probably familiar with something I once said:  
　"If you do anything every day for ten years, you’ll undoubtedly become proficient. You’ll make a living out of it. If not, I’d bet my neck on it."  
　In the West, Malcolm Gladwell also wrote about how it takes 10,000 hours of practice to succeed in any field. That's quite well-known too.

I’m not sure if there’s scientific evidence behind this, but this idea feels incredibly real to me. Engaging in something every day, sticking with it without giving up, you gradually find that there are more things you can do without having to consciously think about them. It’s like running form—over time, you start running with good form without having to consciously adjust your posture. As you accumulate these unconscious skills, by the time you hit 10,000 hours, your brain and body have integrated the "skills," "techniques," and "strength" into them. It's as if you, as a person, have "transformed" to become adept at something.

I believed in this concept up to this point, but recently, I've been wanting to add a sequel to this "theory." I can't say it at length, but let’s call it the "New Proficiency Theory of 2025." It goes, "Being proficient alone won’t feed you." It sounds harsh, but stopping at just proficiency is pointless. "Always learning, always teaching each other" is what’s important. It's not about being proficient or even half-proficient; it's about "the victory of those who keep learning and teaching." Come to think of it, even Yoshimoto-san did that. And he did it naturally, with joy.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. My expression might not have been the best, but I shared something very important.
