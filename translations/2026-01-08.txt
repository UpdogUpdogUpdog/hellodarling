Observing the ever-changing world without getting lost in it.  
By Shigesato Itoi

・In the grand tapestry of history, the things that persist indefinitely are surprisingly few. Jobs and professions, tools and machines, even entertainment and leisure—sometimes customs and ethics—all of these evolve and transform.

These days, there's much chatter about which jobs might vanish in the future. Indeed, there are bound to be many professions that will disappear. Consider the occupations from the Edo period; some of those no longer exist. You won't find palanquin bearers or couriers around anymore.

Even within my own lifetime, I've seen a decline in several trades. Croquette and fried food shops, geta (wooden sandal) stores, kimono shops, hat stores, candy shops, bicycle storage spots, small cinemas, yakisoba stalls... In the era and place where I've lived, many of these "used to be more common" shops have quietly disappeared. In our everyday lives, rooms with tatami mats are becoming rare, and those ubiquitous pickle barrels—where have they all gone?

While I am not entirely devoid of nostalgia, the inevitability of things disappearing is undeniable. The jobs and items said to be vanishing now might have once been the new creations of their time. Yet, not everything that diminishes truly vanishes. Some are preserved as cultural treasures, and as long as there are people who appreciate their value, they remain as "luxuries." What was once the rare and costly possession of "nobility" now belongs to those who can afford it. Eventually, what the "nobility" esteemed becomes something "everyone" desires. Thus, a niche for "affordable luxury" is carved out. Through these cycles of ebb and flow, the times continue to progress.

I often find myself asking, "Would this have been desirable in the Muromachi period?" because it simplifies the thought process.
