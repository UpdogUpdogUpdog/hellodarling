Above all, it's about people.  
Shigesato Itoi

For many years, I've lived in a way that suits me, and I've grown increasingly convinced of a few things. There are several, but one thought has become particularly strong in recent years: "It's really about people, isn't it?" This is something our predecessors have been saying all along.

Takeda Shingen once said, "People are the walls, people are the castle," emphasizing that people are more important than any stronghold. Katsu Kaishu remarked, "To gain people is to gain success." Even business leaders like Eiichi Shibusawa, whose wisdom is handed down through generations, have insisted that "people are the greatest asset." While strategies, facilities, and finances are often highlighted as crucial, the idea that "people are paramount" is shared by many, as if to say, "The truth is..."

I feel like I'm starting to grasp what those who came before us have been trying to convey (I often think about this while watching Major League Baseball). However, the important matter of "people" takes time. Suppose there's a remarkable 30-year-old on your team; it has already taken 30 years for them to become who they are. A skyscraper can be built in a few years. Even the most sophisticated facilities don't take 30 years. But humans—born as tiny babies—grow and develop over decades, playing, studying, falling in love, making mistakes, and taking what seem like pointless detours. Not to brag, but it's taken me 77 years to get here. Sure, it might not take that long for everyone, but reaching a point where "people are the walls" takes time.

It's not like we created an organization through some elite selection process, but after 27 years, "Hobonichi" has finally reached this point. We may have our shortcomings, but I think we're at least a "breezy stone wall." This team couldn't have been built overnight, either.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. Moreover, as someone grows, so do the people around them.
