I can't quite tell if it's summer fatigue or something else entirely.

About two years ago, it suddenly dawned on me. "Ah, so this is what they call summer fatigue!" I had always been aware of the concept—losing appetite, feeling exhausted or sluggish, struggling to sleep well, losing motivation—all those symptoms supposedly brought on by the summer heat. People often talked about "summer fatigue," and I assumed it was one of those things that just happened. But I never thought I was personally experiencing it. Then, about two years ago, I began to sense that my vague physical symptoms matched the idea of "summer fatigue."

Still, I always thought of "summer fatigue" as something that hit you hard in late summer after you’d overexerted yourself in the heat. Yet this year, even though summer has only just begun, I'm already feeling the symptoms. It seems I am indeed experiencing "summer fatigue." It's frustrating; it wasn't a particularly sweltering day, and it doesn't seem to be COVID, which is making the rounds again. Nor do I think it’s whooping cough, so it must be "summer fatigue," right?

It seems getting plenty of sleep is crucial. I used to be able to sleep for ten hours, but now I barely manage six, so I need to address that. I should also cut back on all the cold drinks. As for my appetite, whether it's there or not, I still manage to eat properly, so I'm not too worried about that. I do go out during the day, but not for long periods, so I suppose that's fine, too. Speaking of which, I bought a sun umbrella for the Expo, and I've been using that.

As I write this late at night, I feel my energy returning and the "summer fatigue" subsiding. Have I recovered, or is today's episode just over? Honestly, I can't quite make sense of my own health sometimes.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. Wednesday kicks off with a big team meeting. I wonder how it will go?
