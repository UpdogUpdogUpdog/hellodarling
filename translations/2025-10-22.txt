“Only is not Lonely”  
by Shigesato Itoi

I’ve never been great at remembering numbers or proper nouns, so I can't recall exactly when it was, but one day, the phrase “Only is not Lonely” appeared on the intro image of the homepage of “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun.” It could be translated into Japanese as “ひとりでいることは、孤独ではない,” which roughly means “being alone is not being lonely.” Since I’m not particularly skilled in English, some people told me, “It’s not quite right in English.” However, after consulting with various English speakers, a few native speakers said, “It sounds poetic, so it works.” Somehow, I decided to settle on “this is fine.”

I vividly remember the moment this phrase was born. It was the middle of the night, and I was writing content for the next day’s “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun.” It was around 3 a.m., which meant most people were probably asleep. Yet, in this age of the internet, I knew someone somewhere was awake, just like me, doing their own thing alone. If I called out, “I’m alone. Are you alone too? Hey, are you awake?” I believed that voices would echo back, “Hey!” from solitary souls scattered all over the world. Being alone doesn’t really mean being alone, does it? That realization washed over me, almost bringing me to tears. Being the only one doesn’t mean being lonely. I felt that being “Only” wasn’t “Lonely.” I decided to make “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun” a place where people could feel that connection.

You don’t need to be part of a crowd to hold hands. You can become part of a community without constantly reaffirming it. When you feel it’s not quite right, you can gently let go. Instead of forcing a constant connection, blinking on and off is perfectly fine. By connecting and reconnecting, trust can be built. There was a night when this entire image came to me at once. Although much time has passed since then, I’ve often thought that I still feel the same way. These “solitary” souls have grown into something quite fascinating.

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun” today. I’m truly grateful to have created something like “Hobo Nikkan.”
