To the Little Us,  
By Shigesato Itoi

・Finding joy in the simplest things.  
　Laughing over small, silly moments.  
　Exchanging trivial gifts, giving and receiving.

　Wallowing in trivial worries.  
　Getting grumpy over minor annoyances.  
　Griping about the heat or the cold.

　Chatting endlessly about things that don't really matter.  
　Brooding over insignificant troubles.  
　Pushing ourselves despite being underestimated.

　Singing off-key songs.  
　Winning or losing in a slow-motion race.  
　Hanging out with less-than-stellar friends.  
　Falling for someone you've never even met.

　Living idly in an ordinary town.  
　Gazing up at the sky with nothing better to do.

　When you can't do all that anymore,  
　that's when you realize it was all a treasure.  
　That's probably just how it is.  
　We tiny beings, smaller than a grain of sand,  
　are as vast as the entire universe.

　Because within our small selves,  
　everything already exists.

　(On August 15, 2025, these thoughts crossed my mind.)
