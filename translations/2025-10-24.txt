People and eras are like pickles.  
Shigesato Itoi

One day, by chance, I was at home watching "Tetsuko's Room." The guests were B-Saku Sato, Akira Emoto, and Takashi Sasano. They were all quite seasoned, veteran performers. Since Akira Emoto and I are the same age and have crossed paths a few times, I was curious to see what kind of conversation the three of them would have. At first, Emoto didn't say much. But it was clear he wasn't in a bad mood. The trio, comfortable in their camaraderie and skilled in their craft, sat back and let the conversation flow. Watching them, and Tetsuko included, their relaxed chemistry was entertainment in itself. It didn't matter what they talked about; it was just fun to watch. It was as if a group of theater youth from the same era had gathered for some inexplicable reason. The reason, it turned out, was that these three were going to perform together on stage. In other words, their appearance was partly promotional. But that aside, they seemed genuinely happy. The play was to be staged at the Meijiza Theater in autumn, running for about ten days. "For us, who hail from small theater troupes, to perform together on the grand Meijiza stage for the first time," their excitement was infectious, and I could feel it too.

So, I thought, I must be in the audience for this, and I asked Kuramochi to help secure tickets. I wanted to go with Okuno, who had done this before, and Yamashita, a fellow small theater member. But the tickets were nearly sold out. "I could only get one," Kuramochi said, which was a good sign! Clearly, everyone had felt the same excitement from watching them.

And so, there I was, perched in the farthest corner of the second floor, watching the play alone. It was a "heartfelt comedy." In the past, it might have been akin to the flavor of Kanbi Fujiyama or his daughter Naomi Fujiyama, but this performance had a bit more bite, a modern twist. The audience, too, was like a grand assembly of people from the same era. Those who were young during the age of rock, the underground, rebellion, and the red and black tents were now gathering for a "heartfelt comedy" at Meijiza. Frogs from different ponds were now croaking joyfully and naturally in the vastness of the world.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today.  
Just before, I had been at Ginza's 80th-anniversary event.
