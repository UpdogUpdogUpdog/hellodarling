I'm not particularly fond of charging cables.

How many of these cables do I actually own? Too many to count, really. All sorts—long, short, sturdy, tangle-free. Every time I switched my iPhone or iPad model, the previous Lightning cables became obsolete, leading to a sudden influx of new ones. Recently, everything's been transitioning to "Type C," so things have settled down a bit, though some devices still stubbornly cling to the trapezoidal "Type B." If this is all starting to sound like gibberish, I get it. I had to look things up as I wrote. In fact, I used to just call them "cords" instead of "charging cables" myself.

When I travel, the set I use to charge my devices at the hotel is neatly organized in a "drawer pouch," containing two chargers, three cables, and a plug adapter. Additionally, I have a small cloth bag with a charger and cable for quick access on trains like the Shinkansen, which I use often. In the bedroom at home, there's a stand-up charger, and the same type is conveniently placed by my work desk and next to the sofa. Of course, there's a cable ready in the car's front seat as well.

Isn't this a bit ridiculous? If "ridiculous" isn't the right word, perhaps "foolish" is better. Even after throwing away a fair number, countless cables still lurk in drawers and boxes around the house. How did I end up amassing so many?

It's probably the anxiety of "what if I can't charge when I need to?" that has turned me into this "cable hoarder." My intention is to be prepared for any emergency, to avoid being caught off-guard. Even though I want to change this about myself, I just can't seem to. Oh, and I've purchased multiple batteries too, always chasing the latest "better new model." I know I'm being foolish.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. I bet my boss at home only has one or two cables.
