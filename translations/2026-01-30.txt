The Notion of "Something Better"  
by Shigesato Itoi

・We all have moments when we think there's "something better" out there than what we currently have. Imagine a strawberry in front of you. It's beautiful, fresh, and looks delicious. You take a bite. It's tasty. You eat another—delicious. But then, either you or someone nearby starts to wonder. "This strawberry is good, but isn't there a better one out there?" or "I've had better strawberries before." There's nothing wrong with that thought. If you're at a gathering of farmers dedicated to strawberry research, such ambition and enthusiasm would be commendable. However, if you're at a regular family dinner and someone suddenly remarks, "There are better strawberries," it would likely come off as an unwelcome comment.

In everything—people, situations—there's always room for "something better." That's a given. Even if it doesn't exist now, "something better" might appear somewhere, someday. But there are times when it's appropriate to entertain such thoughts, and times when it's not. "Aiko, I love you. There might be someone better out there, but you're the best choice I have right now," is probably not a proposal you should make. The idea or imagination of "something better" has its moments when it's permissible and times when it's absolutely not. In stories and legends, "great figures and artists" often express dissatisfaction even in the face of good results, exclaiming, "This won't do!!" But that's their story. We're not Kaibara Yuzan or Yamaoka Shiro, after all.

People who have a grounded approach to life know when to entertain the thought of "something better" and when to set it aside, adapting to the situation at hand.
