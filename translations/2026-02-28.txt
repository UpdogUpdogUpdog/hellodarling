Good habits can make a person reluctant to venture out.

・People have so-called "good habits." 
   Drinking hot water or vegetable juice every morning, 
   eating yogurt, brushing teeth before and after meals, 
   maybe even using dental floss, taking a morning bath too. 
   Yes, maybe a jog around the neighborhood, walking the dog, 
   a bit of exercise doesn't hurt, perhaps yoga is also nice. 
   Even just making radio calisthenics a habit is certainly beneficial. 
   Of course, let's not forget to weigh ourselves, monitor our blood pressure. 
   But before that, ensure you get plenty of sleep, 
   change into freshly laundered underwear, 
   and keep your meals balanced and moderate. 
   If you have chronic conditions, take your medication as prescribed. 
   Skim through the newspaper while thoroughly reading the important sections. 
   Dress according to the weather—heat, cold, rain, wind, humidity— 
   whether you’re walking to the station or chatting with others, everyone has their routine.

   Up to this point, I’ve been writing while pondering, 
   but I wonder if the readers find this tedious? 
   Listing out these "good habits," 
   even the writer starts to feel a bit bored. 
   It must be a hassle to do all of this. 
   I understand these aren’t particularly difficult tasks. 
   If one decides to do them, they’re all quite doable. 
   In fact, I believe there are quite a few people who actually do.

   However, I realized that when you meticulously stack up these "good habits," 
   it becomes harder to set out on a journey. 
   Yes, this is about myself, too. 
   In my case, there aren't that many, 
   but I do have a fair share of daily habits. 
   Before every trip, I have to create a checklist 
   and pack my belongings accordingly. 
   Moreover, there's the laptop, power supply, 
   and the tools needed to write "this draft" every day.

   In truth, I’d love for "going on journeys" to become a "good habit," 
   but it conflicts with other "habits." 
   How does everyone else manage, I wonder?

Thank you for visiting "Almost Daily" again today. 
I really need to let my cute, homebody self travel more.
