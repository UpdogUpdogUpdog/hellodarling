Rock may have grown old, but don't worry, it's not dying.

・No, I'm not saying this in a self-deprecating way.  
It's more like watching the river flow, just observing and feeling it.  
These days, when you look at people who emerge under the theme of "rock,"  
they almost always have a head full of white hair.  
The ones strumming their guitars with their long hair swaying,  
whether their hair is white or thinning, they seem happy as they play,  
and that's nice, but you can't help but notice how many years have passed.  
There were so many people who treated "rock" almost like a belief system,  
in cities, villages, and across the seas,  
and there was that iconic phrase, "Never trust anyone over thirty."  
Even when I was under thirty, I thought, "Can you really say that?"  
because inevitably, you would reach that age yourself.

Eventually, the years passed, just as they do.  
Naturally, both the era and the youth moved away from "rock."  
It became more like, "What is rock?"  
and we ourselves had firmly become "old."  
It's not funny, of course—I'm old too.  
I personally like "rock," but I never treated it like a faith,  
so I didn't have to force myself.  
Well, I think most people on stage tried to keep some distance from that "faith."  
Regardless, "rock" has been tidied away as a format of a certain era.  
So it's not that "rock" has ended; it's just that a shelf has been made to store it.  

It's not that it ended—like back then, even now, "JAZZ" exists.  
It's been alive all along, and those recorded moments of "that era" remain.  
Japanese "kayōkyoku" certainly hasn't ended either,  
and I believe it's not just for nostalgia; it must still be alive.  
When you think about it, the way "chanson" has carried on is quite fascinating.  
On November 15th (at Sogetsu Hall),  
I'm even prepping before I go.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today.  
So many things turn silver with age. That's just how it is.
