Musings of Kiju-chan  
Shigesato Itoi

・It's about myself, so I'm not really surprised, but today, November 10th, I turned 77. It's a double lucky number, known as "Kiju." You can't rush this; it takes 77 years to get here. You can't just skip grades and jump to Kiju.

Since I know "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" is read by seniors older than me, people in their prime, a lot of young folks, and even high school, middle, and elementary school students, I imagine there are many ways my words might be received.

I've often tackled topics like "aging and death," and the thought of middle schoolers reading about that feels quite wonderful. Whether they understand or not, whether they relate or not, just hearing someone else's story is important. For a 13-year-old, a 77-year-old's Kiju might seem like a distant landscape. There aren't many places where such different worlds intersect. Conversely, I find myself wanting the stickers that young kids are collecting.

People often talk about divisions and conflicts, but there's a lot that gently blends together, and that's what we truly desire. Water and oil are often cited as things that don't mix, but hey, in dressing, vinegar and oil blend just fine. Thanks to advances in translation apps, it seems "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" is becoming more accessible to people overseas. I'm just jotting down these thoughts with a light heart.

Though the years have added up, I'm still full of energy. Lately, I see myself as an orchard keeper. After more than a quarter century of diligently planting saplings, the flowers are blooming, and the fruits are starting to come in. I still want to plant new fruits and explore juices and other processes. There's so much still unfinished and so much I want to do, so I can't just step back at Kiju. Though, truth be told, it does feel a bit too busy sometimes.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. I'm truly grateful that you read, engage, and have fun with it.
