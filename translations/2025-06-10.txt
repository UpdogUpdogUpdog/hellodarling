Thoughts on Teruhiko Yumura  
By Shigesato Itoi

・I met Teruhiko Yumura again after quite some time. He's like a concentrated essence of style, six years my senior. I've encountered many things I considered stylish, but in my mind, Yumura is the epitome of elegance. Even now, every little thing about him strikes me as effortlessly chic. The period when I saw him most often was around when I was 25, and back then, I thought, "I mustn't imitate this." Compared to someone with such innate style, anyone attempting to mimic it would inevitably come off as lame. So I resolved, "I'll give up on trying to be like that." On reflection, I realize that I've felt "I mustn't imitate" about nearly everyone I admire. Their brilliance is their own treasure, something only they should possess. If you want to appreciate it, just ask them. There's no need to imitate or create a counterfeit.

・Meeting someone you knew when you were young always brings a touch of awkwardness for both parties. Initially, things tend to be a bit stilted. Yet, as the conversation progresses, the rhythm of the exchange gradually settles in. "Itoi-kun, even in that thing by Shuntaro Tanikawa, he said something good," he suddenly recalled, "I only caught it on the news, though." It made me pause and think, "Did I really say something worthwhile?" "That part about wanting to touch someone and realizing you hadn't," he prompted. Ah, that's right. Yumura considered that a "good thing." I had spoken with Tanikawa many times, but never touched or embraced him—a natural occurrence between two men, yet I found myself wishing I had. It was gratifying that Yumura recognized and appreciated that sentiment. We then took a photo with his hand on my shoulder, as if saying "here we go." It might sound like a joke, but I'm truly glad we made that connection. It was a day when two old men, aged 83 and 76, finally reached out to each other.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. Being alive and able to meet in good health—it's a wonderful thing.
