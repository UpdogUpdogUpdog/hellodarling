The Remark of "He's Smart, Though"

Shigesato Itoi

There was likely a time when physical strength was a crucial asset. Though I can't say for certain if that's true, back in the day, among kids, the strong ones were esteemed. Eventually, while being strong remained a notable trait, being smart started to gain more importance. You can't always use brute strength to assert dominance unless the situation calls for it, but you can assert intellectual superiority almost anywhere.

What does it really mean to be "smart"? That's not entirely clear to me. Simply possessing obscure knowledge might earn you the label of being smart. Solving complex problems and passing exams could do the same. Mastering logic and rhetoric to outwit others in debate might also qualify. Just like physical strength or athletic ability, being smart is a significant talent, often compared against others.

Yet, the phrase "if you have energy, you can do anything" seems more convincing than "if you're smart, you can do anything." Despite frequent comparisons, it feels as though the value of being smart is quietly diminishing. Just as physical strength became merely one of many valuable traits, perhaps being smart has met the same fate. People might say, "He's strong, but..." in the same breath as, "He's smart, but..." This is quite a realistic observation. Even for me, when considering colleagues or friends, I don't necessarily prioritize the smart ones. However, society seems to overvalue intelligence, as if it still holds paramount importance. Just as cranes replaced raw strength, the rookie "AI" has emerged as the successor to human intelligence.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. Nowadays, the value of being "interesting" seems to be on the rise, doesn't it?
