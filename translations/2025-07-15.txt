Reflections on the Osaka-Kansai Expo  
Shigesato Itoi

・So here I am at the Osaka Expo.  
  I bought a season pass all the way back in April,  
  but it was one of those situations where I kept wondering, "When am I actually going to use this?"  
  Well, the day finally arrived.  
  To be honest, the process is a bit of a hassle.  
  Just having a ticket doesn't mean you're all set.  
  There's so much to prepare for.  
  As someone who finds "planning" and dealing with my shellfish allergy nerve-wracking,  
  I've been on edge right up until today.  
  But I suppose the best thing I did was muddle through and take a photo of the QR code,  
  so I could pull it up quickly when needed.

  Another blessing was coming here with a photographer.  
  He's brisk yet leisurely as we wander around the venue,  
  which is exactly how I hoped to enjoy this experience.  
  I’m allergic to "planning," and "studying ahead" isn't my forte,  
  and I don't intend to be overly ambitious, yet  
  I'm already fully enjoying myself.  
  I don't even bother to enter any of the pavilions,  
  so I'm free from the hassle of standing in lines.  
  Plus, the rain is on and off, and it's a Monday, so it's not too crowded.  
  Just strolling around aimlessly is quite delightful,  
  like being at a grand shrine festival.

  Since I didn't do any prior research, Hatano-san pointed me to  
  the "Forest of Tranquility," a green area in the center of the venue.  
  It's wonderful, perfectly embodying this year's personal theme for me:  
  "weeds" sprawling out beautifully like a lush marsh.  
  Upon closer inspection, you can see how carefully it's all been planted.  
  With weeds and shrubs at its core, surrounded by a grand roof ring,  
  my personal satisfaction shot up considerably.  
  The grand roof and the thematic pavilions are full of visible timber.  
  That "Myaku-Myaku" thing—it's like arteries and veins, right?  
  It feels like a theater stage with living beings as the stars.  
  Well, truthfully, I still don’t really “get it,” but  
  I think I'll spend another day meandering through this festival before heading home.

Thank you again for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today.  
I want that Forest of Tranquility and the grand roof ring. Please, someone, give them to me!
