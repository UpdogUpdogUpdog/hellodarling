Both Strong Teeth and a Healthy Body

Shigesato Itoi

ãƒ»Last week, I underwent dental surgery. I'm not well-versed in the technical details, but I believe it involved setting an implant. Essentially, a screw-based foundation was embedded into my jawbone. Since my jawbone itself had diminished, I spent about a year cultivating new bone. What was once spoken of as a "dream regenerative treatment" is now just another option available to us.

The day of the surgery finally arrived. I braced myself, expecting it to take about an hour, but I was mistaken. During the procedure, I couldn't see a clock since I was looking up the entire time. I had a sense it was taking quite a while. Although the tools and the scene inside my mouth kept changing, a long silence persisted. When it was over, they removed the treatment apron, and I finally checked my watch. To my surprise, two and a half hours had passed. Not quite a national treasure, but as long as a lengthy movie. The doctor spoke to me, "You must have had a tough time. It took longer than expected. Thank you for your patience."

Sure, I was tired too, but I thought about how arduous it must have been for the doctor, who concentrated intently on my mouth for two and a half hours, working on my gums and jawbone. It wouldn't have been out of place for him to exclaim, "Wow, that was tough!" If it were me, I might have said something like that. But instead, he acknowledged my discomfort, saying, "You must have had a tough time," even though I was the one with my mouth open, staring into the bright light. It's such a subtle gesture, but this thoughtfulness resonates with me, fostering a sense of trust. This is what professionalism is all about. Though I've been under this doctor's care for a long time, I was reminded of his admirable qualities. With my mouth still numb from the anesthesia, I mumbled a thank you, "Ai aou o ai aita," and got up from that distinctive chair.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" today. The health of both my teeth and body is maintained thanks to many professionals.
