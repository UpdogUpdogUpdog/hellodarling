Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun and Gagaku  
by Shigesato Itoi

The other day, there was an event at Shibuya Parco that was truly fascinating. It featured performers of gagaku, a cellist, and at the heart of it all was Taro Ishida, who transformed that space into "a musical realm never experienced before." During the evening session, Ishida spoke with boundless curiosity, and the audience, seated on a temporary "lawn," was so captivated they leaned forward in their seats.

Reflecting on it, Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun and gagaku never really had any connection. I knew about Hiroyuki Sanada starring in "SHOGUN" in the U.S. and the accolades it received, including praise for its music, but that was the extent of my knowledge. Ishida was the composer for that drama. It all started with an email from Ishida expressing his desire to share the intrigue of gagaku, which quickly forged a connection between us. Hobo Nikkan provided a platform for this conversation, and it allowed us to introduce it to a wide audience who found it fascinating. Interestingly, this initial dialogue on Hobo Nikkan led to an increase in requests for Ishida's lectures and performances from people who mentioned they saw it on our site.

It seemed like a coincidence, yet it wasn't merely that. Ishida's wish to share gagaku with everyone prompted him to reach out to us at Hobo Nikkan, and somehow, it resonated with us, creating a bond. Relationships arenâ€™t just random occurrences; they require a moment of mutual acknowledgment. I often talk about the importance of "TRYing," and I find myself truly impressed by how significant it is. (As I write this, Ishida's composition "Tokoyo" plays in the background.)

Thank you for visiting Hobo Nikkan again today. Perhaps, fate is more important than luck.
