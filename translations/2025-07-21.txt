Universal suffrage, equal voting, secret ballot.

・The speed of election result bulletins always takes me by surprise. I catch myself watching the announcements of projected winners with the same thrill as if I were watching a race. It might seem strange to view such important news in this way, but I've realized that this is indeed how I perceive it. The interviews and reactions add to the excitement, accompanied by those pinging sounds, while the latest updates scroll endlessly across the screen. From evening mealtime until late into the night, these election updates aim to captivate our attention.

When someone says, "This is important!" they are undoubtedly right. But did we always need to relay this information so urgently? Keeping the TV on the whole time, I feel like I'm spending my time in a peculiar way. During periods involving major elections, it feels as if society lets go of a certain restraint, and to be honest, I'm not entirely comfortable with it.

One realization, albeit a bit late, has dawned on me. Almost everything about my schedule is laid bare to the folks at "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun." I go about my daily life with little to hide in what I say or write. Yet, there are a few things I do keep to myself. Just like everyone else, there are personal matters I don't share—not that anyone, no matter how impolite, would ask. It's akin to keeping on a pair of underwear. Among these few secrets, I realized, is my voting behavior at the polling station. Some people choose to disclose how they vote, but I do not. 

As an individual, I might be making incorrect choices on the ballot, and if I were to voice them, it might alter my decisions. We all learned this in social studies: it's called the "secret ballot," a fundamental principle of elections. This little secret of mine, in a life that's almost entirely exposed, feels incredibly important. It's not like my voting choices are particularly surprising, though.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" again today. Let's remember the importance of the earnest things you do every day.
