"Ramen. That's Japan's magic."

I've always liked ramen, and I still do, but if you ask me if I'm a ramen maniac, I wouldn't say so. I'm not that kind of person who has an intense passion for something. I don't have comprehensive knowledge or experience. I'm not trying to know everything about the world of ramen. And I'm not systematic about it either. My knowledge and memories aren't organized (it's similar to how I like baseball, but I'm not a baseball maniac).

I just eat ramen as I please, go wherever I want to eat ramen, and say things like "this is delicious" or "I want to go back." I even go to great lengths, like traveling far alone or waiting in long lines, so people might think I'm enthusiastic. But actually, I've recently become a bit more serious about being a casual ramen fan. I happened to watch BS-TBS's "Ramen to Taberu" (Eating Ramen) program, which introduces various popular and famous ramen shops in 30 minutes. What's common among all the shops is their "work enthusiasm." They make delicious ramen with absolute dedication, without sparing any effort. Especially, the way they make the "soup" is remarkable. From the selection of ingredients to the way they heat it, the time they spend, and the confidence they have in their finished product, it's truly serious. This is magic that surpasses science and logic. You can't explain how it's made, but you know it can't be any other way. It's not something AI could choose, and it's not the magic of a witch, but the magic of Japanese craftsmen. And people go to eat the ramen made with this magic. It's not a religion or superstition, just a bowl of ramen. And it's a secret ritual that anyone can participate in for around 1,000 yen. "Wow, this shop is doing things like this?" I think, and it's no wonder I go to eat ramen while looking at the map. "Ramen is Japan's magic." - Itoi Shigesato
