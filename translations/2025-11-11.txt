Thoughts from Yesterday.  
By Shigesato Itoi

・Holding hands. Taking someone's hand. Clasping hands.

When you hold someone’s hand, you can feel the texture, the softness, the strength, and the warmth of that hand. Those who have clasped hands with another know this. Yet, when it comes to my own hand, I am clueless. I’ve never tried to understand it.

If I were to clasp my right hand with my left, I might get a sense of the feeling. I could convince myself that I understand. But in truth, I don’t. Because both the right hand and the left hand belong to "me," I can describe the texture, temperature, and softness in words, but alas, that's all—there's no actual feeling.

The joy, surprise, gentleness, strength, or comfort that someone else might feel from touching my hand is something I will never experience. What my hand conveys to another person is truly beyond my grasp.

In essence, the things about "myself" remain utterly unknown unless I make a conscious effort to understand them. Even then, my understanding is superficial, like one hand trying to know the other. Just as I live constantly with a part of myself that remains a mystery, everything in this world is an intricate puzzle. We've merely decided, for convenience, that we understand it. Words and symbols are just temporary resting spots for this supposed understanding.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nichi" again today. It takes another person to hold hands. And yet, that other person is also part of yourself.
