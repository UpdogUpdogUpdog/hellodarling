Pouring drinks, and a thought about escalators.  
Shigesato Itoi

・Yesterday, here,  
I gingerly broached the question, "Has anything good ever come from pouring drinks?" At gatherings where alcohol flows freely, has anyone truly benefited from pouring a drink for someone or having a drink poured for them? I suspect not. It wasn't a call to abolish the custom of pouring drinks, but more of a reflective question aimed at the act itself. I said it, and the day passed without anyone taking offense. Yet, I don't believe that from tomorrow onward, people at social gatherings with drinks will suddenly start questioning the practice of pouring drinks. I'm sure many end-of-year parties still feature this ritual. It's not that I absolutely want it to stop; I'll just watch gently as the practice gradually fades away.

However, when it comes to people walking on escalators, I can't shake the feeling of unease. This is something I want to address more firmly. "Has anything good ever come from walking on escalators?" "Has leaving one side open achieved anything beneficial?" Sure, maybe you reached the ticket gate a bit sooner by walking or rushing past. Good for you. Meanwhile, I, just standing there being transported, arrived only three seconds later. I can hardly resist saying something like that. On days when I'm feeling well, I even make a point of standing on the right side to become a "wall" against those who try to walk past (on days I'm not feeling great, I avoid conflict). The station posters clearly state to use both sides, and they even prohibit walking, which everyone knows. Yet, many people still leave one side open. There are those who walk briskly up long, long escalators, panting all the way. Let me ask again, "Did rushing at the station ever lead to anything worthwhile?" Did it save you from being late, or give you five extra seconds at work? Did someone praise you for being an edgy and impatient urbanite? Well, I suppose one day escalators will naturally accommodate two lines of standing people, and how things are now will just be a story from the past.

Thank you for visiting “Hobo Nikkan” again today.  
Standing two abreast increases capacity and is safer. If only.
