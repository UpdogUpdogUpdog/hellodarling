Is there really a need to rush and start things early?  
by Shigesato Itoi

・You often hear stories about professional athletes or artists beginning their journey at the tender age of three, picking up a guitar or starting to play catch. Sure, there are anecdotes of people who have been at it since childhood, and those cases do exist. However, in reality, most professionals went to regular schools until high school, and some didn't even receive specialized education in college. They acquire "knowledge, wisdom, and skills" in the actual workplace.

In the realm of competitive sports vying for world gold medals or music battles in international competitions, there might be a method focused on a specific goal. Yet, most "jobs" out there involve joining as a "rookie" in adulthood, gradually learning through repeated successes and failures over time.

Watching programs that introduce "professionals," I often find myself impressed by experts in their respective fields. But even they weren't working as plasterers at three, performing surgery at five, or making sushi in elementary school.

Having interests from childhood, like enjoying certain activities, might indeed be important. As Confucius said, and I find myself quoting him often, "There is no match for learning as being fond of it," and "Being fond of it is no match for enjoying it." Starting as a "newcomer" in adulthood, if you find what you're doing "enjoyable," then learning and fondness will naturally follow.

You know, most things are quite often started later than you might think. Starting now isn't "too late," is it? Especially since we're not aiming to be number one in the world.
