The "Hobonichi" Team  
Shigesato Itoi

・With "Hobonichi," we like to brag about how quickly we can wrap things up, but that's only part of it—we're also known for our ability to intensely focus when needed. It might seem like we're always "working as one," but that's not quite the case. It's hard to explain, and I'm not sure everyone agrees, but we consciously avoid becoming too unified. From the tug-of-war events to the "Lifestyle Festival," there are plenty of moments when we all come together. Today, for example, is the annual "Shareholders' Meeting," which really brings everyone's efforts into a tight focus. Yet, once that's over, we quickly disperse again. It's like a cycle of concentration and dispersion.

When we're in the thick of things, teamwork is everything. We support each other and push our limits, embodying that sense of unity. However, I believe the goal shouldn't be unity for its own sake. At the core of "Hobonichi," we acknowledge that everyone is fundamentally different. Our starting point is "Only is not Lonely." Collaborating on projects is enjoyable and empowering, and it allows us to bring joy to others. Still, I think the essence lies in each individual's contribution. I have a feeling everyone here loves "Hobonichi." They love the people gathered and the environment itself. This feels different from traditional company loyalty. It's more about "this environment enables me to thrive, so I want to nurture it in return." We're still evolving, but what do you think?

The "Hobonichi" that says "Only is not Lonely" has somehow become a "team" in action. I've been pondering what this means and came up with a phrase that complements "Only is not Lonely": "One team. Many selves. A single team, countless individuals." I believe this includes you, too.

Thank you for coming to "Hobonichi" today. We come together as individuals—like grains of rice forming a rice ball.
