That's not how it usually goes.

・The other day, as part of a sporadic project at "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun," I had a conversation with Nurse Asami, who had just published a book. I'll let you read about the contents when it gets published on "Hobo Nikkan," but there was something Asami, an active nurse, said in passing that left a deep impression on me. "When people pass away, it's not like in movies or dramas, where they lie in bed, surrounded by family, and quietly slip away," she remarked. Coming from a nurse who has witnessed countless such moments, her words carried a weighty sense of reality. The conversation continued beyond that, but it struck me—those common scenes are often remembered as if we've seen them somewhere before.

We tend to imagine things based on what we've seen in movies or on TV. When I was a kid, American family dramas were all the rage, and while I enjoyed watching them, I hated when a drunken father would shout at the TV, "There's no such thing as a family like that; it's all a lie." As an adult, I've heard similar things said repeatedly. "There's no such thing as a family without problems," they'd assert. As a grown-up, I understand that now. Every person has a past, present, and future, with connections running in every direction—up, down, sideways, near, and far. Human relationships are just as varied. The idea of a perfectly round and smooth happiness is nothing more than a pie in the sky. We often find ourselves picturing an "ideal family," but such a thing doesn't exist in reality. Life is full of scars, cracks, fractures, and patches. And that's perfectly natural. We can still enjoy dramas for what they are, of course.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. There are days of health, with aches and itches, too.
