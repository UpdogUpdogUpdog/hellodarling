Isn't it okay to take your time with weaning?

When writing for a general audience, it can be difficult to use the word "breast." However, when discussing a baby breastfeeding, it's perfectly acceptable to use the term. Today, I'm going to write about "breasts" in that context.

There's a little girl I know—though I won't say exactly who. She supposedly weaned at one point, yet she grew to be someone with a strong fondness for "breasts." She always found reasons to bring them up in conversation and would casually try to touch them whenever she could. In her household, "breasts" were referred to as "mamma," and even before she weaned, she would frequently ask for "mamma," leading her mother to exasperatedly ask, "More mamma?" Eventually, "mamma" became known as "more mamma." Now that she's in elementary school, I wonder if she's grown out of it.

As for me, I spent my early years apart from my mother, so hearing about this girl's "more mamma" was quite novel to me. The inseparable bond between a mother and child struck me as both enviable and fascinating, prompting me to reconsider it in my later years. Perhaps spending a significant amount of time in such a close, inseparable relationship makes for a richer life. Just as I was pondering this, I came across yet another remarkable example this year.

This person—a man—grew up to be a pleasant and happy member of society, but as a child, he adored his mother and was incredibly attached to her. Even after starting school, he couldn't wean himself. When friends came over to play, if it was his "feeding time," he would cleverly send his friends home so he could nurse. He's now a respectable adult with a healthy family. I believe his stability comes from having more than enough "breastfeeding" during his early years. Being thoroughly loved and nurtured is a wonderful thing. Discipline is important, but a full measure of love is paramount.
