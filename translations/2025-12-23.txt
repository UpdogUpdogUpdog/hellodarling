Words Fail Me  
by Shigesato Itoi

・I want to emphasize the importance of "words failing" us. This isn't just something I wish to convey to young people, but also to those in their prime working years, to the elderly, to babies, and even to myself.

Speaking eloquently or being a master of presentations—these are valuable skills in the professional world. The polished speech of an announcer is pleasant to listen to, and it's a testament to their rigorous training.

We are grateful for those who can explain anything with clarity. They probably spend a great deal of time thinking things through. They articulate their thoughts in a way that aligns with the listener’s understanding, and we are truly thankful for that.

However, if you (or I) ever find ourselves thinking, "Words fail me," perhaps we should pause our efforts to articulate those elusive thoughts so perfectly. Let's keep them just as they are.

Let's resist the urge to wrap everything up neatly in words that feel like the "right answer." There are people who excel at that. I suspect AI is the best at it.

But feeling like you have this bundle of thoughts or emotions—whether it's a solid mass, a wisp of smoke, or even just a scent—nestled in your chest, that's probably a distinctly human experience.

These unutterable thoughts might one day reveal themselves in another form—perhaps in a dream, through someone else's words, or carried on the wind. When that happens, let's have a good laugh about it.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan" today. I think I'm probably someone who excels at having words fail him.
