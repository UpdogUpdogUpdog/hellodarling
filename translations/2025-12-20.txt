Jōmō Karuta  
Shigesato Itoi

・"Drawing water to one's own rice paddy"—it means bending things to suit your own needs. It happens all the time. "Praising one's own miso" is another expression; it’s about boasting of your own creations. It's self-congratulation, and it’s quite common too. "Soul food" refers to the deeply familiar dishes and foods from one's hometown, the kind that taste wonderful to you, no matter what others say.

Even if I try hard not to be self-serving or boastful, I can't help but indulge in a bit of local pride. I'm only human, after all. I could easily eat five skewers of yaki-manju. I thought I'd left my uncomfortable hometown far behind, yet as an adult, I find myself gradually reconnecting. I may not voice it, but I silently cheer for it. Sometimes I worry about Gunma and Maebashi, hoping they remain vibrant and lively places. Konjac being a local specialty or the greatness of Shimonita leeks—things that didn't matter to me as a child—now make me say, "Yes, they are delicious." I know that to people from other regions, these things might not be a big deal, but I still carry a small, hidden pride. I don't want to be accused of bragging about my own miso, yet here I am. Whether it’s with a casual "well" or with genuine enthusiasm, I feel I’ve truly reconciled with Gunma and Maebashi.

And now, what I find myself appreciating anew is "Jōmō Karuta," an educational and folk toy. It's a unique Gunma creation that incorporates the local specialties, figures, history, and events of the region into an iroha karuta card game. I believe every elementary school in Gunma teaches this game. I think every prefecture should create something similar. With karuta, you could memorize about 50 pieces of knowledge. We could even create a "Hobonichi Karuta" if we wanted to.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today. May your hometown be as lively and vibrant as you are.
