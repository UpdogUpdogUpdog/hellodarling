Even the present will eventually become the past.

People often find themselves thinking, "Things were better in the old days." Being just like everyone else, I sometimes catch myself doing the same. Reflecting on those days, I realize there were indeed many good moments. Perhaps that's true, but the past that people claim was so wonderful is no longer here. Even if remnants remain, the past itself is gone.

The only choice is to create something akin to "the good old days." Patching together what's left or reheating memories to recreate "something like the good old days" can be costly. Yet, if everyone decides it's worth having, or if enough people desire it, then "something like the past" might just be recreated.

Crafting something that others regard as "good" is undoubtedly a commendable endeavor. But isn't it a bit too dismissive of the present if we constantly think, "The past was better"? Admittedly, each day brings an unending stream of unpleasant news about the present. Many speak of a worsening "now." They say this dire situation is unprecedented, but from what I've seen, people have always said that about their times. Even if we were to scour the annals of world history, we'd likely find few periods where people declared, "These are truly great times." That's why the past, which we somehow managed to get through, tends to be remembered fondly. Of course, I harbor those feelings as well.

But then again, if we think like that, must the children born just recently live through an "now" devoid of joy and a future that only worsens? I don't quite think that's the case. We must carefully observe the "now" that exists before us and seek hope in the "future" that lies ahead. We owe it to the future as adults who have lived through quite a bit of "the past."
