Might as well go for a Positive Play.  
Shigesato Itoi

To be honest, I'm not exactly a naturally positive person. I often find myself brooding over this and that, contemplating what to do if things don't work out. Somehow, though, I've managed to get by, and for that, I must admit I'm both fortunate and grateful. Generally, I'm the type to worry right up until the last moment, and when the time finally comes, I throw myself into it with a "here goes nothing" attitude because worrying at that point won't help.

Despite my own tendencies, I have a hard time dealing with people who are constantly negative. I might even blurt out something like, "There's no point in saying things like that," despite being a worrier myself (which might be why). I'm a complicated guy.

But let's think this through. When negative thoughts start creeping in—like when bad data emerges, when situations tend to hit a dead end, when it seems like no one agrees, or when I begin to think, "Oh, maybe it's all hopeless"—even if my pessimistic predictions turn out to be right, there's nothing to be happy about.

So, instead of voicing those thoughts, I try to think, "This time, things will go well." If I can genuinely believe that, great. But if my mind and heart can't help but waver, I decide to engage in a "positive play." It's fine if I can't fully believe it; like a charm, I simply think positively and say it out loud. If I turn out to be right, it'll boost my confidence, and I'll want to keep going. If I'm wrong, there's always next time, and I'll think positively again then. Though I've come to this realization late in life, with limited time left, I've decided to go forward with a "positive play" approach (these thoughts were heavily influenced by my conversation with Mr. Sō Taguchi last night).

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today.  
I'm determined to part ways with "the particularly pessimistic me when it comes to baseball."
