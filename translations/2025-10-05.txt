Like everyone else, I'm finding myself obsessing over AI these days.

・These days, it’s impossible to avoid thinking about AI. It’s said that AI can handle most of the tasks humans do, and not only that, it might even do them better. Honestly, we're beyond the point of just worrying about being outpaced. The era when we amateurs fretted about AI overtaking us is already in the past. In reality, we've likely been surpassed in many areas.

I recently came across a news story about how the actors' union in Hollywood is protesting. They argue that the expressions and performances of "AI-created actors" are a theft, using the hard-earned expressions of human actors as "training data" without permission. While this movement is still in its early stages, it's likely that we'll need to develop quite complex rules (including legal frameworks) in the future.

Imagine an "AI actor" that embodies everything people desire, everything they find beautiful. It works tirelessly without causing scandals, similar to the evolution of machine civilization, always moving in the direction deemed "better" (and supported). AI can perform dangerous stunts endlessly without fear, and as long as it’s not required to portray complex emotions, there seems to be plenty of demand. It could even mimic subtle flaws or personality quirks.

This brings to mind the evolution of cosmetic surgery. Nowadays, everyone is working towards a defined "ideal image of beauty," and as a result, everyone starts to look alike. In a way, "AI actors" are at a similar stage, but eventually, we might crave an "imperfect beauty" that feels just right. When that happens, natural "imperfect beauty" might become even more valuable. It all seems a bit complicated, doesn’t it? Even this essay I’m writing now could be edited to be more readable, and I’m sure it would be easier to digest.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. What makes us happy, and what brings us joy? That's the real question, isn’t it?
