Writing is for the joy of reading.

・There are things so close to us in our daily lives  
  that we almost forget to talk about them.  
  They become such an integral part of us.  
  Yet, even now, they can still surprise us with new discoveries.

Looking back at what I scribbled on January 10, 2024, "Pork miso soup, tomato & basil, curry," I realized something. On that day two years ago, I was still in the original building, pondering menu ideas without even a name for the place. I documented it all in my "Hobonichi Techo" because I didn't want to forget the day I decided, "Yes, let's start from here." I've done this countless times.

The real discovery is something a bit different. While we think of writing in diaries or notebooks—or even memos—as "writing," I realized I've been too focused on that aspect. That's why people say, "I can't handle it," or "I don't know what to write," treating it like a daunting task. But that's not it. The charm of these notebooks lies in the fact that opposite "WRITE" is "READ." It's like photography, where the joy comes not just from taking the picture but from viewing it later.

When I jot down something like "what I ate that was delicious" in my "Hobonichi Techo," it feels insignificant at the moment. Yet, reading it later brings me joy. The content of "writing" doesn't matter at all. You could even think of it as something to "read" later.

Today, I plan to write something like this:  
"Cutting an hour from work or reading to sleep an extra hour."  
I'll write the same thing on another day, thinking about when I'll read it.

Thank you for visiting "Hobonichi" today.  
There's also the notion that "a child's cuteness is best seen in their sleeping face."
