Starting something gives you the room to fail.  
Shigesato Itoi

・For those familiar with "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun," this might be a well-known concept: "Nothing begins if you don't start." This was one of the first things I learned, and apparently, our brains are wired in such a way that motivation comes after we begin something, not before. It's not like motivation wells up and then we can do things. Even if you feel too sleepy to get up, once you’re awake, you’re awake. That's how it is. This piece of "wisdom" has been life-changing for me, someone naturally timid and prone to procrastination. Of course, there are times when it's better to dawdle, to let thoughts and ideas ripen. But even knowing that, I still say: "Once you start, things really do begin."

Today, we're having a small retreat meeting, and looking back at everything "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" has done, there’s seldom been a time when everything was clearly laid out, with goals defined and ready to launch. In 2011, when we created, it was only after that we came up with projects like the Treehouse Tourism Association and Kesenuma Knitting. If we had created detailed plans beforehand, the sheer volume and weight of what needed to be done might have stopped us from ever starting. Even with the, it was initially made as a "cool planner" for ourselves. We didn't have any stores besides our own online shop willing to sell it. Plus, in the first year, there was a suspicion of defects, and we ended up sending replacements to all our customers. But you see, by starting, we gave ourselves the chance to fail.

The interesting, good, and sometimes worthless things we've done all happened because we started them. Discussing these things at our meetings is so enjoyable and fascinating that I can't stop.

Thank you for visiting "Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun" today. I burned my finger near the campfire, so I'm typing without using my middle finger.
