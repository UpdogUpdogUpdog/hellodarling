What Matters More Than What Matters

"Whenever you think you're doing something good, it's probably best to entertain the notion that you might also be doing something a little bad," said Yoshimoto Takaaki. I can't quite remember when I first heard this, but as time goes on, it strikes me as something genuinely important.

It’s a paradoxical statement, quintessentially Yoshimoto, yet looking back now, it aligns closely with Shinran’s teachings: "Even the good can attain rebirth, how much more so the wicked."

"Good deeds," "great deeds," and "important deeds" can intoxicate a person. People become so focused on these "important" and "good" things that they ignore the "bad" and "small" things. This, I think, is where they go wrong.

Before I had the chance to meet Yoshimoto, I read an essay by Taeko Tomioka. She mentioned spotting Yoshimoto Takaaki in the evenings, carrying a shopping basket. The thought of Yoshimoto, the mind behind "The Theory of Collective Illusions," preparing dinner, while poet Taeko Tomioka quietly observed in the twilight of a downtown setting—it seemed strikingly genuine, a simple fact of life. Even in my early twenties, I found it quite admirable.

Additionally, there’s a story, perhaps more of a rumor, about Akashiya Sanma saying of Takuya Kimura, "Kimura’s great because he properly does the dad thing." I completely agree, and I think it’s wonderful that Sanma chose to highlight that. Probably, Kimura would respond with a puzzled look, saying, "But I am a dad," wondering what's so great about it. Yet, that’s exactly the point—it’s an incredibly important thing, precisely because it’s something that seems simple but is often hard to do.
